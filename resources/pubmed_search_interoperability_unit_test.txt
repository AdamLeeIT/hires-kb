AB  - BACKGROUND: Information technology has shifted paper-based documentation in the 
      health care sector into a digital form, in which patient information is 
      transferred electronically from one place to another. However, there remain 
      challenges and issues to resolve in this domain owing to the lack of proper 
      standards, the growth of new technologies (mobile devices, tablets, ubiquitous 
      computing), and health care providers who are reluctant to share patient 
      information. Therefore, a solid systematic literature review was performed to 
      understand the use of this new technology in the health care sector. To the best 
      of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic literature reviews 
      that focus on Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based electronic 
      health records (EHRs). In addition, FHIR is the latest standard, which is in an 
      infancy stage of development. Therefore, this is a hot research topic with great 
      potential for further research in this domain. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this 
      study was to explore and perform a systematic review of the literature related to 
      FHIR, including the challenges, implementation, opportunities, and future FHIR 
      applications. METHODS: In January 2020, we searched articles published from 
      January 2012 to December 2019 via all major digital databases in the field of 
      computer science and health care, including ACM, IEEE Explorer, Springer, Google 
      Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. We identified 8181 scientific articles 
      published in this field, 80 of which met our inclusion criteria for further 
      consideration. RESULTS: The selected 80 scientific articles were reviewed 
      systematically, and we identified open questions, challenges, implementation 
      models, used resources, beneficiary applications, data migration approaches, and 
      goals of FHIR. CONCLUSIONS: The literature analysis performed in this systematic 
      review highlights the important role of FHIR in the health care domain in the 
      near future.

      bibliometric analysis and future perspective.
PG  - 161-166
LID - 10.4103/picr.picr_272_22 [doi]
AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) constitute vital statistics, current health 
      condition, ongoing therapies, and patient data; hence, their interoperability 
      could be useful for epidemiologic and clinical research. Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and blockchain are currently "in-use" and 
      tested for exchange of such data. The annual scientific production of 
      publications for both FHIR and blockchain shows steady growth. The data 
      interoperability and electronic data interchange have been introduced in the 
      field of EHR in 2020, hence inferring that data interoperability is relatively a 
      new domain. The thematic mapping suggested "interoperability" of EHR is 
      well-developed and important for the structure of the research field.

TI  - Interoperability with multiple Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources 
      (FHIR(®)) profiles and versions.
PG  - ooad001
LID - 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooad001 [doi]
LID - ooad001
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a method for evaluating the interoperability of Fast 
      Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR(®)) clients and servers supporting 
      different FHIR resources, profiles, and versions, and to determine the 
      feasibility of FHIR servers supporting multiple FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A method of analysis, the FHIR Interoperability Table 
      (FHIT), is proposed. The FHIT involves the concept of a "catchment," the type or 
      category of data that a profile is intended to represent. The solution first 
      aligns sender and/or receiver profiles according to their catchments, then 
      determines the relationship between the admittances of those profiles, and 
      finally interprets the relationship in terms of the feasibility of data exchange. 
      RESULTS: The FHIT method is demonstrated by analyzing the FHIR-based exchange 
      between the US Core IG and the International Patient Summary IG. DISCUSSION: The 
      last few years have witnessed a significant growth in Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR), resulting in several major versions of FHIR, 
      hundreds of IGs, and thousands of FHIR profiles. Previous work and available 
      tools have not fully addressed the problem of interoperability between clients 
      and servers that support different FHIR resources, profiles, and versions. 
      CONCLUSION: Application of the proposed methodology allows interoperability 
      problems in FHIR networks to be identified. In some cases, new profiles that 
      resolve those conflicts can be derived, using intersections of the original 
      profiles. There is a need for additional tools that implement the proposed 
      method, as well as structured methods for expressing catchments in FHIR profiles.

TI  - An HL7 FHIR and GraphQL approach for interoperability between heterogeneous 
      Electronic Health Record systems.
PG  - 14604582211043920
LID - 10.1177/14604582211043920 [doi]
AB  - Heterogeneities in data representation and care processes create interoperability 
      complexity among Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs). We can resolve such 
      data and process level heterogeneities by following consistent healthcare 
      standards like Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), OpenEHR, and HL7 FHIR. 
      However, these standards also differ at the structural and implementation level, 
      making interoperability more complex. Hence, there is a need to investigate 
      mechanisms that can resolve data level heterogeneity to achieve semantic data 
      interoperability between heterogeneous systems. As a solution to this, we offer 
      an architecture that utilizes a resource server based on GraphQL and HL7 FHIR 
      that establishes communication between two heterogeneous EHRs. This paper 
      describes how the proposed architecture is implemented to achieve 
      interoperability between two heterogeneous EHRs, HL7 FHIR and OpenMRS. The 
      presented approach establishes secure communication between the EHRs and provides 
      accurate mappings that enable timely health information exchange between EHRs.

TI  - State-of-the-Art Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-Based Data 
      Model and Structure Implementations: Systematic Scoping Review.
PG  - e58445
LID - 10.2196/58445 [doi]
LID - e58445
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data models are crucial for clinical research as they enable 
      researchers to fully use the vast amount of clinical data stored in medical 
      systems. Standardized data and well-defined relationships between data points are 
      necessary to guarantee semantic interoperability. Using the Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for clinical data representation would 
      be a practical methodology to enhance and accelerate interoperability and data 
      availability for research. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to provide a 
      comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and current landscape in 
      FHIR-based data models and structures. In addition, we intend to identify and 
      discuss the tools, resources, limitations, and other critical aspects mentioned 
      in the selected research papers. METHODS: To ensure the extraction of reliable 
      results, we followed the instructions of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) 
      checklist. We analyzed the indexed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, 
      IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. After identifying, 
      extracting, and assessing the quality and relevance of the articles, we 
      synthesized the extracted data to identify common patterns, themes, and 
      variations in the use of FHIR-based data models and structures across different 
      studies. RESULTS: On the basis of the reviewed articles, we could identify 2 main 
      themes: dynamic (pipeline-based) and static data models. The articles were also 
      categorized into health care use cases, including chronic diseases, COVID-19 and 
      infectious diseases, cancer research, acute or intensive care, random and general 
      medical notes, and other conditions. Furthermore, we summarized the important or 
      common tools and approaches of the selected papers. These items included 
      FHIR-based tools and frameworks, machine learning approaches, and data storage 
      and security. The most common resource was "Observation" followed by "Condition" 
      and "Patient." The limitations and challenges of developing data models were 
      categorized based on the issues of data integration, interoperability, 
      standardization, performance, and scalability or generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: 
      FHIR serves as a highly promising interoperability standard for developing 
      real-world health care apps. The implementation of FHIR modeling for electronic 
      health record data facilitates the integration, transmission, and analysis of 
      data while also advancing translational research and phenotyping. Generally, 
      FHIR-based exports of local data repositories improve data interoperability for 
      systems and data warehouses across different settings. However, ongoing efforts 
      to address existing limitations and challenges are essential for the successful 
      implementation and integration of FHIR data models.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is 
      widely used in health information technology. However, its use as a standard for 
      health research is still less prevalent. To use existing data sources more 
      efficiently for health research, data interoperability becomes increasingly 
      important. FHIR provides solutions by offering resource domains such as "Public 
      Health & Research" and "Evidence-Based Medicine" while using already established 
      web technologies. Therefore, FHIR could help standardize data across different 
      data sources and improve interoperability in health research. OBJECTIVE: The aim 
      of our study was to provide a systematic review of existing literature and 
      determine the current state of FHIR implementations in health research and 
      possible future directions. METHODS: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web 
      of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published 
      from 2011 to 2022. Studies investigating the use of FHIR in health research were 
      included. Articles published before 2011, abstracts, reviews, editorials, and 
      expert opinions were excluded. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and registered this study 
      with PROSPERO (CRD42021235393). Data synthesis was done in tables and figures. 
      RESULTS: We identified a total of 998 studies, of which 49 studies were eligible 
      for inclusion. Of the 49 studies, most (73%, n=36) covered the domain of clinical 
      research, whereas the remaining studies focused on public health or epidemiology 
      (6%, n=3) or did not specify their research domain (20%, n=10). Studies used FHIR 
      for data capture (29%, n=14), standardization of data (41%, n=20), analysis (12%, 
      n=6), recruitment (14%, n=7), and consent management (4%, n=2). Most (55%, 27/49) 
      of the studies had a generic approach, and 55% (12/22) of the studies focusing on 
      specific medical specialties (infectious disease, genomics, oncology, 
      environmental health, imaging, and pulmonary hypertension) reported their 
      solutions to be conferrable to other use cases. Most (63%, 31/49) of the studies 
      reported using additional data models or terminologies: Systematized Nomenclature 
      of Medicine Clinical Terms (29%, n=14), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and 
      Codes (37%, n=18), International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (18%, 
      n=9), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (12%, n=6), 
      and others (43%, n=21). Only 4 (8%) studies used a FHIR resource from the domain 
      "Public Health & Research." Limitations using FHIR included the possible change 
      in the content of FHIR resources, safety, legal matters, and the need for a FHIR 
      server. CONCLUSIONS: Our review found that FHIR can be implemented in health 
      research, and the areas of application are broad and generalizable in most use 
      cases. The implementation of international terminologies was common, and other 
      standards such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data 
      model could be used as a complement to FHIR. Limitations such as the change of 
      FHIR content, lack of FHIR implementation, safety, and legal matters need to be 
      addressed in future releases to expand the use of FHIR and, therefore, 
      interoperability in health research.

      and Exchange Using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR).

AB  - With the proliferation and growing complexity of healthcare systems emerges the 
      challenge of implementing scalable and interoperable solutions to seamlessly 
      integrate heterogenous data from sources such as wearables, electronic health 
      records, and patient reports that can provide a comprehensive and personalized 
      view of the patient's health. Lack of standardization hinders the coordination 
      between systems and stakeholders, impacting continuity of care and patient 
      outcomes. Common musculoskeletal conditions affect people of all ages and can 
      have a significant impact on quality of life. With physical activity and 
      rehabilitation, these conditions can be mitigated, promoting recovery and 
      preventing recurrence. Proper management of patient data allows for clinical 
      decision support, facilitating personalized interventions and a patient-centered 
      approach. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a widely adopted 
      standard that defines healthcare concepts with the objective of easing 
      information exchange and enabling interoperability throughout the healthcare 
      sector, reducing implementation complexity without losing information integrity. 
      This article explores the literature that reviews the contemporary role of FHIR, 
      approaching its functioning, benefits, and challenges, and presents a methodology 
      for structuring several types of health and wellbeing data, that can be routinely 
      collected as observations and then encapsulated in FHIR resources, to ensure 
      interoperability across systems. These were developed considering health industry 
      standard guidelines, technological specifications, and using the experience 
      gained from the implementation in various study cases, within European 
      health-related research projects, to assess its effectiveness in the exchange of 
      patient data in existing healthcare systems towards improving musculoskeletal 
      disorders (MSDs).

TI  - HL7 FHIR with SNOMED-CT to Achieve Semantic and Structural Interoperability in 
      Personal Health Data: A Proof-of-Concept Study.
LID - 10.3390/s22103756 [doi]
LID - 3756
AB  - Heterogeneity is a problem in storing and exchanging data in a digital health 
      information system (HIS) following semantic and structural integrity. The 
      existing literature shows different methods to overcome this problem. Fast 
      healthcare interoperable resources (FHIR) as a structural standard may explain 
      other information models, (e.g., personal, physiological, and behavioral data 
      from heterogeneous sources, such as activity sensors, questionnaires, and 
      interviews) with semantic vocabularies, (e.g., Systematized Nomenclature of 
      Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)) to connect personal health data to an 
      electronic health record (EHR). We design and develop an intuitive health 
      coaching (eCoach) smartphone application to prove the concept. We combine HL7 
      FHIR and SNOMED-CT vocabularies to exchange personal health data in JavaScript 
      object notion (JSON). This study explores and analyzes our attempt to design and 
      implement a structurally and logically compatible tethered personal health record 
      (PHR) that allows bidirectional communication with an EHR. Our eCoach prototype 
      implements most PHR-S FM functions as an interoperability quality standard. Its 
      end-to-end (E2E) data are protected with a TSD (Services for Sensitive Data) 
      security mechanism. We achieve 0% data loss and 0% unreliable performances during 
      data transfer between PHR and EHR. Furthermore, this experimental study shows the 
      effectiveness of FHIR modular resources toward flexible management of data 
      components in the PHR (eCoach) prototype.

AB  - Although FHIR has been designed to be easy to implement, it requires knowledge 
      that is still hard to find. We aim to evaluate the use of FHIR in Portuguese 
      projects for the integration of medical devices. Two projects were selected, 
      including easyHealth4Covid (EH4C) and Chronic Diseases Management Platform 
      (CDMP). The evolution of each project and the FHIR resources used were analyzed. 
      11 different sensors of 5 companies were used in the sum of both projects. 
      Previously, none of them used FHIR to integrate and the teams had little to no 
      experience in doing so. The FHIR Observation resource was used for all. There is 
      a general lack of knowledge of the FHIR standard and terminologies of most of the 
      device companies involved in the projects.
