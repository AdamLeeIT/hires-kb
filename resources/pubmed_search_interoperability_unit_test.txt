SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), a comprehensive terminology with over 360,000 medical concepts, supports this need. However, it cannot cover all medical scenarios, particularly in complex cases. To address this, SNOMED CT allows postcoordination, where users combine precoordinated concepts with new expressions. Despite SNOMED CT's potential, the creation and validation of postcoordinated expressions (PCEs) remain challenging due to complex syntactic and semantic rules. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to develop a tool that validates postcoordinated SNOMED CT expressions, focusing on providing users with detailed, automated correction instructions for syntactic and semantic errors. The goal is not just validation, but also offering user-friendly, actionable suggestions for improving PCEs. METHODS: A tool was created using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) service $validate-code and the terminology server Ontoserver to check the correctness of PCEs. When errors are detected, the tool processes the SNOMED CT Concept Model in JSON format and applies predefined error categories. For each error type, specific correction suggestions are generated and displayed to users. The key added value of the tool is in generating specific correction suggestions for each identified error, which are displayed to the users. The tool was integrated into a web application, where users can validate individual PCEs or bulk-upload files. The tool was tested with real existing PCEs, which were used as input and validated. In the event of errors, appropriate error messages were generated as output. RESULTS: In the validation of 136 PCEs from 304 FHIR Questionnaires, 18 (13.2%) PCEs were invalid, with the most common errors being invalid attribute values. Additionally, 868 OncoTree codes were evaluated, resulting in 161 (20.9%) PCEs containing inactive concepts, which were successfully replaced with valid alternatives. A user survey reflects a favorable evaluation of the tool's functionality. Participants found the error categorization and correction suggestions to be precise, offering clear guidance for addressing issues. However, there is potential for enhancement, particularly regarding the level of detail in the error messages. CONCLUSIONS: The validation tool significantly improves the accuracy of postcoordinated SNOMED CT expressions by not only identifying errors but also offering detailed correction instructions. This approach supports health care professionals in ensuring that their PCEs are syntactically and semantically valid, enhancing data quality and interoperability across systems.", 'CI': ['(c) Tessa Ohlsen, Viola Hofer, Josef Ingenerf.

The lack of interoperable medication data within and across hospitals not only creates administrative burden through redundant data entry but also increases the risk of errors due to human mistakes, imprecise data transformations, and misinterpretations. While digital solutions exist, fragmented systems and non-standardized data continue to hinder effective medication management. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess medication data available across the multiple systems of a large university hospital, identify a minimum data set with the most relevant information and propose a standard interoperable FHIR-based solution that can import and transfer information from a standardized drug master database to various target systems. METHODS: Medication data from all relevant departments of a large German hospital were thoroughly analyzed. To ensure interoperability, data elements for developing a minimum dataset were defined based on relevant medication identifiers, the Health Level 7 Fast Health Interoperability Resources (HL7(R) FHIR(R)) standard, and the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) specifications. The dataset was further enriched with information from Germany's most comprehensive drug database and European Standard Drug Terms (EDQM) to enhance medication identification accuracy. Finally, data on 60 frequently used medications within the institution was systematically extracted from multiple medication systems and integrated into a newly structured, dedicated database. RESULTS: The analysis of all the available medication datasets within the institution identified 7,964 drugs. However, limited interoperability was observed due to a fragmented local IT infrastructure and challenges in medication data standardization. Data integrated and available in the new structured medication dataset with key elements to ensure data identification accuracy and interoperability, successfully enabled the generation of medication order messages, ensuring medication interoperability and standardized data exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach addresses the lack of interoperability in medication data and the need for standardized data exchange. We propose a minimum set of data elements aligned with German and international coding systems, to be used in combination with the FHIR standard for processes such as the digital transfer of discharge medication prescriptions from intensive care units to general wards, which can help to reduce medication errors and enhance patient safety.", 'FAU': ['Salgado-Baez, Eduardo', 'Heidepriem, Raphael', 'Delucchi Danhier, Renate', 'Rinaldi, Eugenia', 'Ravi, Vishnu', 'Poncette, Akira-Sebastian', 'Dahlhaus, Iris', 'Furstenau, Daniel', 'Balzer, Felix', 'Thun, Sylvia', 'Sass, Julian'], 'AU': ['Salgado-Baez E', 'Heidepriem R', 'Delucchi Danhier R', 'Rinaldi E', 'Ravi V', 'Poncette AS', 'Dahlhaus I', 'Furstenau D', 'Balzer F', 'Thun S', 'Sass J'], 'AD': ['Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (CVK/CCM), Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.', 'Core Unit Digital Medicine and Interoperability, Berlin Institute of Health at Charite, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (CVK/CCM), Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.', 'Core Unit Digital Medicine and Interoperability, Berlin Institute of Health at Charite, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.', 'Institute for Diversity Studies, TU Dortmund University, Dortmund, DE.', 'Core Unit Digital Medicine and Interoperability, Berlin Institute of Health at Charite, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.', 'Stanford Mussallem Center for Biodesign, Stanford University, Stanford, US.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.', 'Core Unit Digital Medicine and Interoperability, Berlin Institute of Health at Charite, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.', 'Core Unit Digital Medicine and Interoperability, Berlin Institute of Health at Charite, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, DE.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20250131', 'PL': 'Canada', 'TA': 'JMIR Med Inform', 'JT': 'JMIR medical informatics', 'JID': '101645109', 'SB': 'IM', 'EDAT': '2025/02/27 18:20', 'MHDA': '2025/02/27 18:20', 'CRDT': ['2025/02/27 14:03'], 'PHST': ['2025/02/27 18:20 [medline]', '2025/02/27 18:20 [pubmed]', '2025/02/27 14:03 [entrez]'], 'AID': ['10.2196/64099 [doi]'], 'PST': 'aheadofprint', 'SO': 'JMIR Med Inform. 2025 Jan 31. doi: 10.2196/64099.'}

However, strict data protection regulations, fragmented infrastructures, and resistance to change hinder progress. These challenges leave care institutions reliant on outdated paper-based workflows, particularly for patient data transmission, despite the pressing need for efficient tools to support health care professionals amid a nursing shortage and rising demand for care. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to analyze Germany\'s care transition record (CTR) and CTR transmission process as part of transition management and suggests improvements toward a seamless digital solution. METHODS: To understand the current challenges of manual CTR transfers, we used a mixed methods approach, which included a web-based questionnaire with nursing professionals, field observations, business process model and notation modeling, semantic and frequency analysis of CTR entries, and user story mapping. RESULTS: A web-based questionnaire involving German nursing professionals (N=59) revealed considerable delays in patient care due to manual, patient-transferred CTRs. Of the 33 usable responses (n=33), 70% (n=23) of the respondents advocating for digital transmission to improve efficiency. Observations (N=11) in care facilities (n=5, 45%) and a hospital (n=6, 55%) confirmed the high administrative burden, averaging 34.67 (SD 10.78) minutes per CTR within a hospital and 44.6 (SD 20.5) minutes in care facilities. A semantic analysis of various CTRs (N=4) highlighted their differences and complexity, stressing the need for standardization. Analyzing a new CTR standard (care information object CTR) and manually mapping an existing CTR to it showed that the procedure was ambiguous, and some associations remained unclear. A frequency analysis of CTR entities revealed which were most used. In addition, discussions with care staff pointed out candidates for the most relevant entities. On the basis of the key findings, a stepwise transition approach toward a road map proposal for a standardized, secure transfer of CTRs was conceptualized. This road map in the form of a user story map, encompassing a "CTR transformer" (mapping of traditional CTRs to a new standard) and "care information object CTR viewer/editor" (in short, CIO-CTR viewer and editor; a new standard for viewing, editing, and exporting), shows a possibility to bridge the transition time until all institutions fully support the new standard. CONCLUSIONS: A future solution should simplify the overall CTR transmission process by minimizing manual transfers into in-house systems, standardizing the CTR, and providing a secure digital transfer. This could positively impact the overall care process and patient experience. With our solutions, we attempt to support care staff in their daily activities and processes until nationwide state regulations are implemented successfully, though the timeline for this remains uncertain.', 'CI': ['(c)Elisabeth Veronica Mess, Matthias Regner, Sabahudin Balic, Lukas Kleybolte, Lisa', 'Daufratshofer, Andreas Mahler, Sabrina Tilmes, Viktor Werlitz, Claudia Reuter,', 'Alexandra Teynor.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) and the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) supported the development of standards-compliant, consent-respecting medical record exchange technology using metadata labeling (e.g., substance use information). Existing technologies must be updated with newer standards and support more than binary-sensitive categorizations to better align with how physicians categorize sensitive medical records. OBJECTIVES:  Our goal was to deploy, pilot test, and share open-source Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based data segmentation technologies. We pilot-tested the technologies using real-world patient electronic health record data in the context of substance use information. We involved physicians in designing a novel decision engine that supports various confidence levels. RESULTS:  We deployed a web-based Patient Portal and Clinical Decision Support (CDS) granular data segmentation Engine to allow patients to make consent-based granular data choices (e.g., not sharing substance use medical records). Compared with previous solutions, the Engine innovates by using the latest Health Level 7 (HL7) standards to support data sensitivity labeling and redaction: FHIR R5 and its Consent resource type and CDS Hooks. It also supports configurable floating point confidence threshold cutoffs as opposed to binary medical record categorizations. Multiple engineering choices were made to simplify software development and maintenance and to improve technology adaptability, reusability, and scalability.

In this context, modular systems have the potential to act as a catalyst for change, offering the capacity to encapsulate and combine functionalities in an adaptable manner. The objective of this scoping review is to determine the extent to which modular systems are employed in the medical field. The review will provide a detailed overview of the effectiveness of service-oriented or microservice architectures, the challenges that should be addressed during implementation, and the lessons that can be learned from countries with productive use of such modular architectures. The review shows a rise in the use of microservices, indicating a shift towards encapsulated autonomous functions. The implementation should use HL7 FHIR as communication standard, deploy RESTful interfaces and standard protocols for technical data exchange, and apply HIPAA security rule for security purposes. User involvement is essential, as is integrating services into existing workflows. Modular architectures can facilitate flexibility and scalability.

The integration of electronic health records (EHRs) is urgently needed in military healthcare systems, despite the distinct hurdles involved. Current literature on EHR use in military healthcare is lacking and disjointed. This study aims to bridge this gap through a systematic review, offering a thorough examination of the advantages, obstacles, and recommended strategies for implementing EHRs in military healthcare environments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the PRISMA guideline, a comprehensive electronic search of all relevant literature on the topic was carried out across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, ProQuest, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, SID, and ISC up to July 20, 2024. The inclusion criteria involved choosing English-language articles that were available in full text and closely aligned with the study's objectives. The data extraction sheet for each study included information including the authors, publication year, country, research goals, architecture and components, context, processes involved, standards utilized, platform and technology, level of implementation, interoperability issues, challenges faced, information resources, and significant findings. RESULTS: A total of 9,618 titles were retrieved from different databases. After removing duplicates, 6,051 titles were left. Upon evaluation, 29 articles were chosen for inclusion in the review. The results show that most of the studies were carried out at the United States Department of Defense (DoD) level with the aim of improving the quality of care and patient safety, as well as integrating healthcare delivery. Additionally, the studies covered various processes such as clinical documentation, appointment scheduling, research, telemedicine, decision support, and computerized physician order entry. Health level seven fast healthcare interoperability resources (HL7 FHIR), clinical document architecture (CDA), health insurance portability and accountability act (HIPAA), international classification of diseases 10th and 9th revision (ICD 10, ICD 9), international organization for standardization technical committees (ISO TC), software development kits (SDKs), and web-based architecture are some of the most important requirements for implementing EHR. The most significant challenges reported in the implementation of EHR included concerns about privacy and security, the sensitive military deployment environment, infrastructure limitations, and interoperability concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers and practitioners can get insight from the findings regarding the standards that must be met, the challenges that must be overcome, and the requirements for EHR implementation in military healthcare settings. It could be a useful starting point when implementing EHRs in military healthcare systems, especially in nations where e-health development and planning are still in their early stages.", 'CI': ['Copyright: (c) 2025 Torab-Miandoab et al.

This paper addresses this challenge by establishing a template of modular requirements for designing a viable Electronic Health Record (EHR) system that enables transmission and sharing of patient data across primary, secondary, and specialized care, ensuring versatility in diverse healthcare environments and across varying socio-economic landscapes. The research is anchored in design science and employs an action research strategy, using northern Brazil as empirical case. The approach builds on generic requirements from standards established by the European Union, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), and the Swedish ePrescription journal system. These requirements are refined and adapted to the Brazilian context through a participatory method, considering development disparities across municipalities and aligning with national policy. A key feature is the integration of knowledge graphs, which, when combined with fieldwork iterations involving healthcare professionals and patient association representatives, facilitated the extraction of patient-centric requirements. Strategies from Brazilian healthcare policies targeting chronic kidney disease, selected as a significant challenge for specialized healthcare in emergent areas, were incorporated to generalize the design of EHR modules aimed at prevention and monitoring of population at risk. Results support that harmonization towards legacy system is strongly advised and discourage the introduction of systems designed from scratch.', 'CI': ['(c) 2024.

This trend is further expedited by implementing consumer-oriented Internet of Things platforms, contributing to the growth of the $8.3 trillion healthcare industry. These advancements, combined with challenges such as heterogeneous data formats and a lack of incentives, necessitate the development of pragmatic infrastructures and tools that harness contemporary clinical standards like Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present a modular conversion pipeline employing a templating strategy for translating clinical data into the FHIR model. Emphasis is placed on utilizing a standard mapping specification like FHIR Mapping Language. This ensures essential properties such as platform independence, portability, and code reusability. METHODS: The pipeline was developed incrementally, dividing its core functionalities into five modules: Input, Refinement, Mapping, Validation, and Export. These were subsequently validated by converting a dataset from a prosthetic fitting and rehabilitation center to demonstrate the approach's validity in a real-world data context. RESULTS: A total of 1962 hospital stay records of 1006 unique patients were converted successfully to 15 distinct types of FHIR resources. The successful conversion states the pipeline's effectiveness, additionally showcasing its capabilities for enhancing semantic interoperability and facilitating the reuse of real-world data. CONCLUSION: Our approach emerges as a modular data conversion framework that addresses the limitations of existing solutions, making significant contributions to the creation of standardized, interoperable, and high-quality clinical datasets that serve as a foundation for further work.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2025 The Authors.

Despite progress in standardizing healthcare data with the FHIR format, hospitals often lack efficient platforms for transferring PHRs, leading to redundant tests and delayed treatments. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralized PHR management system leveraging Personal Data Stores (PDS) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) in line with the Web 3.0 model. Our system features secure interoperability and personal identification masking. Interoperability is achieved through DID digital certificates for verifying PDS addresses and a dynamic access key (AK) system to minimize credential exposure. Data de-identification, including anonymization and encryption, ensures privacy and prevents unauthorized access. We developed a prototype using the Solid open-source library and Hyperledger Aries protocol. Testing showed efficient performance, with DID validations and AK generation under one second, and data operations for 500 MB-sized PHRs completing in two seconds. De-identification processes were both effective and timely. The system demonstrated the ability to manage PHRs securely, empower users with control over their healthcare data, facilitate seamless and secure data transfer between patients and medical entities, and prevent exposure of sensitive information.

RESULTS: We developed FHIR PIT (HL7(R) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Patient data Integration Tool) as an open-source, modular, data-integration software pipeline that consumes EHR data in FHIR(R) format and integrates the data at the level of the patient or subject with environmental exposures data of varying spatiotemporal resolutions and file formats. We applied FHIR PIT to generate "integrated feature tables" containing patient- or subject-level EHR data integrated with environmental exposures data on two cohorts: one on patients with asthma and related common pulmonary disorders; and a second on patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia and related rare pulmonary disorders. The data were then exposed via the open Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service, which was then queried to explore relationships between exposures to two representative airborne pollutants (particulate matter and ozone) and annual emergency department or inpatient visits for respiratory issues. We found that hospitalizations for respiratory issues were more common among patients exposed to relatively high levels of particulate matter and ozone and were higher overall among patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia than among patients with asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Our manuscript describes a major release of FHIR PIT v1.0 and includes a technical demonstration use case and a clinical application on the use of FHIR PIT to support research on environmental exposures and health outcomes related to asthma and primary ciliary dyskinesia. For application of the tool to common data models (CDMs) other than FHIR, we offer open-source conversion tools to map from the PCORnet, i2b2, and OMOP CDMs to FHIR.', 'CI': ['(c) 2025.

However, manufacturers still create closed ecosystems (ie, solutions designed to work end-to-end minimizing collaboration with other organizations) with proprietary interfaces because of various interoperability challenges. Therefore, the aim of this article is to provide an overview of how to achieve organizational interoperability in an open ecosystem (ie, solutions designed to integrate different organizations via interoperability standards) for diabetes management. METHODS: The proposed interoperability design approach called Secure Plug and Play Interoperability (SPPI) supports building and using interoperable system elements in an open ecosystem. Secure Plug and Play Interoperability enables interoperability over the entire system life cycle with its reference architecture, secure interoperability standards, and organizational capabilities. These standards were developed with participation from healthcare providers, regulatory authorities, payers, academia, and manufacturers. Publicly available information provides examples of implementation support and practical usage. RESULTS: Organizational interoperability in an open ecosystem can be achieved through organizational capabilities and a selection of secure interoperability standards. ISO/IEEE 11073, Bluetooth profiles, and HL7 FHIR with test specifications, test tools, software development kits, and quality assurance programs represent a coordinated selection suitable for building an open ecosystem. Practical usage is demonstrated with real-world solutions that build on these standards. CONCLUSIONS: Secure Plug and Play Interoperability facilitates the end-to-end integration of devices, digital products, and services from partners in an open ecosystem.

However, challenges persist in workflow integration, compliance, and widespread adoption. This study leveraged a Learning Health System (LHS) framework to align research and operations using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation protocol, embedded as pragmatic trial operations within the electronic health record (EHR). METHODS: An alpha phase was conducted to pilot technical integration, refine workflows, and determine sample size in planning for a beta phase designed as a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI) as primary outcome. During alpha, bi-directional governance was established between IS operations and LHS team with multidisciplinary workgroups for analytics, technical, documentation, and user experience. Ambient AI was embedded into the EHR using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), with real-time data dashboards tracking utilization and documentation accuracy for operations and research. Performance metrics were monitored serially using a difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to detect drift caused by software workflow changes. RESULTS: The alpha phase, designed as Type 1 Hybrid, informed a 24-week beta phase stepped-wedge trial with 90% power to detect changes in PFI. Across the alpha phase, the weighted median of average provider Ambient AI utilization was 65.4% following Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles addressing organizational feasibility and task-dependent adoption. During initial implementation, a workflow issue caused discrepancies between ICD-10 diagnosis entries and note content, reducing accuracy from 79% to 35% (p < 0.01). After implementing a new note template and provider training, accuracy returned to pre-intervention levels. DiD did not detect significant drifts in work outside of work or time in notes two weeks before and after the new note template. Beta phase enrollment achieved its targeted 66 providers across eight specialties, initiating on schedule. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We provide a novel playbook for integrating Generative AI platforms in healthcare, combining pragmatic trial operations, human-centered design, and real-time monitoring to advance evidence-based implementation.

We examined the current state of birthing person and infant/child (dyad) data-sharing capabilities supported by health information exchange (HIE) standards and HIE network capabilities for data exchange to inform point-of-care needs assessment for the substance-exposed dyad. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-map analysis was performed using a set of dyadic data elements focused on pediatric development and longitudinal supportive care for substance-exposed dyads (70 birthing person and 110 infant/child elements). Cross-mapping was conducted to identify definitional alignment to standardized data fields within national healthcare data exchange standards, the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) version 4 (v4) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) release 4 (R4), and applicable structured vocabulary standards or terminology associated with USCDI. Subsequent survey analysis examined representative HIE network sharing capabilities, focusing on USCDI and FHIR usage. RESULTS: 91.11% of dyadic data elements cross-mapped to at least 1 USCDI v4 standardized data field (87.80% of those structured) and 88.89% to FHIR R4. 75% of the surveyed HIE networks reported supporting USCDI versions 1 or 2 and the capability to use FHIR, though demand is limited.

This ensures efficient, patient-focused healthcare delivery in a mobile world where citizens frequently travel for work and leisure. Beyond healthcare delivery, semantic interoperability is crucial for secondary health data use. This paper introduces a tool and techniques for achieving health data semantic interoperability, using reusable visual transformation components to create and validate transformation rules and maps, making them usable for domain experts with minimal technical skills. METHODS: The tool and techniques for health data semantic interoperability have been developed and validated using Design Science, a common methodology for developing software artifacts, including tools and techniques. RESULTS: Our tool and techniques are designed to facilitate the interoperability of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) by enabling the seamless unification of various health data formats in real time, without the need for extensive physical data migrations. These tools simplify complex health data transformations, allowing domain experts to specify and validate intricate data transformation rules and maps. The need for such a solution arises from the ongoing transition of the Estonian National Health Information System (ENHIS) from Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) to Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), but it is general enough to be used for other data transformation needs, including the European Health Data Space (EHDS) ecosystem.

Despite the increasing number of published algorithms, most remain unvalidated in real-world clinical settings. This study aims to simulate the practical implementation challenges of a recently developed ML algorithm, AI-PAL, designed for the diagnosis of acute leukaemia and report on its performance. METHODS: We conducted a detailed simulation of the AI-PAL algorithm's implementation at the University Hospital Essen. Cohort building was performed using our Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) database, identifying all initially diagnosed patients with acute leukaemia and selected differential diagnoses. The algorithm's performance was assessed by reproducing the original study's results. FINDINGS: The AI-PAL algorithm demonstrated significantly lower performance in our simulated clinical implementation compared to prior published results. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia dropped to 0.67 (95% CI: 0.61-0.73) and for acute myeloid leukaemia to 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65-0.76). The recalibration of probability cutoffs determining confident diagnoses increased the number of confident positive diagnosis for acute leukaemia from 98 to 160, highlighting the necessity of local validation and adjustments. INTERPRETATION: The findings underscore the challenges of implementing ML algorithms in clinical practice. Despite robust development and validation in research settings, ML models like AI-PAL may require significant adjustments and recalibration to maintain performance in different clinical settings. Our results suggest that clinical decision support algorithms should undergo local performance validation before integration into routine care to ensure reliability and safety.

Trust is built through elements such as FAIR data access, interoperability, and improved communication, which are essential for fostering innovation in digital health technologies. This Viewpoint aims to report on exploratory research demonstrating the feasibility of testing a patient-centric data flow model facilitating semantic interoperability on precision medical information. In this global trend, the interoperable interface called Sync for Science-J (S4S-J) for linking electronic medical records (EMRs) and personal health records was launched as part of the Basic Policy for Economic and Fiscal Management and Reform in Japan. S4S-J controls data distribution consisting of EMR and patient-generated health data and converts this information into QR codes that can be scanned by mobile apps. This system facilitates data sharing based on personal information beliefs and unlocks siloed Internet of Things systems with a privacy preference manager. In line with Japanese information handling practices, the development of a mobile cloud network will lower barriers to entry and enable accelerated data sharing. To ensure cross-compatibility and compliance with future international data standardization, S4S-J conforms to the Health Level 7 Fast Health Care Interoperability Resources standard and uses the international standardized logical observation identifiers names and codes (LOINC) to redefine medical terms used in different terminology standards in different medical fields. It is developed as an applied standard in medical information intended for industry, health care services, and research through secondary use of data. A multicenter collaborative study was initiated to investigate the effectiveness of this system; this was a registered, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial, the EMBRACE study of the mobile health app MheartLink for hyperglycemic disorders in pregnancy, which implements an EMR-personal health record interoperable interface via S4S-J. Nevertheless, the aforementioned new challenges, the pivotal Health Level 7 Fast Health Care Interoperability Resources system, and LOINC data mapping were successfully implemented. Moreover, the preliminary input of EMR-integrated patient-generated health data was successfully shared between authorized medical facilities and health care providers in accordance with the patients' preferences. The patient-centric data flow of the S4S-J in Japan is expected to guarantee the right to data portability, which promotes the maximum benefit of use by patients themselves, which in turn contributes to the promotion of open science.", 'CI': ['(c)Yoshihiko Izumida, Takashi Omura, Masahiro Fujiwara, Shoko Nukaya, Akio', 'Yoneyama, Sow Boubacar, Shinichiro Yabe, Rika Noguchi, Shima Nakayama, Wataru', 'Muraoka, Yuki Okuno, Sho Miyashita, Yurika Ishihara, Yuto Moriwaki, Ryoji Otani,', 'Junichiro Adachi, Kenichiro Tanabe, Yoshihisa Yamano, Yasushi Takai, Masaru', 'Honjo.

This report details and assesses the ICAREdata technical implementation and offers recommendations to benefit future projects with similar goals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the ICAREdata project, we implemented tools to collect structured clinical outcome data within EHRs, then extract and transmit the mCODE-formatted data to a secure cloud storage platform. Using the socio-technical model of health information technology, we systematically assessed the technical implementations in this multi-institutional project. RESULTS: We evaluated the ICAREdata method across the 8 inter-related dimensions of the socio-technical model. For each dimension, we identified challenges and developed recommendations that implementers of future initiatives can leverage. DISCUSSION: The ICAREdata project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using data standards for structured data capture and transmission in clinical trials. The lessons learned from this project can accelerate the success of similar initiatives using standards-based real-world data (RWD) capture and transmission for research.

However, current terminology systems lack allergens unique to Japan. OBJECTIVE: This study established a code system encompassing Japanese food and non-food/non-medication allergens (JFAGY), and developed a meta-code system for integration with existing drug code systems. The practicality and limitations of the JFAGY were assessed by profiling HL7 FHIR allergy intolerance. METHODS: Allergen terms were selected based on the Standard Commodity Classification of Japan. Additional terms were extracted from clinical guidelines and public documents. For non-food, non-medication allergens, terms from the clinical guidelines were manually compiled to conform to a classification hierarchy. To validate the coverage of the developed food allergen code system, we extracted 823 unique food allergens, totaling 12,027 entries, from two years of electronic health records (EHRs) and performed manual mapping to the code system. RESULTS: In total, 1,123 food and 607 non-food/non-medication allergen terms were included. The three-digit meta-code system comprises an identifier for coding systems, code length, and allergen categories. The codes allowed the determination of hierarchical relationships between any two terms. The Japanese allergy intolerance value set was developed and bound to the allergy intolerance code. Of the food allergens extracted from EHRs, 62.9% corresponded to unique codes, 6.1% to multiple codes, and 31.0% were unmapped, accounting for 91.5%, 1.9%, and 6.6% of entries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The JFAGY encompasses Japanese-specific food and non-food/non-medication allergens, enabling hierarchy determination between two terms, and playing a critical role in medical safety. When utilizing the JFAGY with the FHIR allergy intolerance resource, an FHIR extension must be included to denote a denied allergy.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

More recently, they have gained attention due to the emergency use authorization of several COVID-19 vaccines. As part of its responsibility to conduct postmarket surveillance, the US Food and Drug Administration continues to monitor several AEs of interest to ensure the safety of vaccines, including those for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study is part of the Biologics Effectiveness and Safety Initiative, which aims to improve the US Food and Drug Administration's postmarket surveillance capabilities while minimizing the burden of collecting clinical data on suspected postvaccination AEs. The objective of this study was to enhance active surveillance efforts through a pilot platform that can receive automatically reported AE cases through a health care data exchange. METHODS: We detected cases by sharing and applying computable phenotype algorithms to real-world data in health care providers' electronic health records databases. Using the fast healthcare interoperability resources standard for secure data transmission, we implemented a computable phenotype algorithm on a new health care system. The study focused on the algorithm's positive predictive value, validated through clinical records, assessing both the time required for implementation and the accuracy of AE detection. RESULTS: The algorithm required 200-250 hours to implement and optimize. Of the 6,574,420 clinical encounters across 694,151 patients, 30 cases were identified as potential myocarditis/pericarditis. Of these, 26 cases were retrievable, and 24 underwent clinical validation. In total, 14 cases were confirmed as definite or probable myocarditis/pericarditis, yielding a positive predictive value of 58.3% (95% CI 37.3%-76.9%). These findings underscore the algorithm's capability for real-time detection of AEs, though they also highlight variability in performance across different health care systems. CONCLUSIONS: The study advocates for the ongoing refinement and application of distributed computable phenotype algorithms to enhance AE detection capabilities. These tools are crucial for comprehensive postmarket surveillance and improved vaccine safety monitoring. The outcomes suggest the need for further optimization to achieve more consistent results across diverse health care settings.", 'CI': ['(c)Matthew Deady, Raymond Duncan, Matthew Sonesen, Renier Estiandan, Kelly', 'Stimpert, Sylvia Cho, Jeffrey Beers, Brian Goodness, Lance Daniel Jones, Richard', 'Forshee, Steven A Anderson, Hussein Ezzeldin.

Central to this initiative is the European Electronic Health Record Exchange Format, designed to achieve interoperability of electronic health record data across Europe. Despite these advancements, the readiness of current guidelines and implementations, such as the European Patient Summary, to support secondary use in clinical research, particularly in cardiology, remains underexplored. METHODS: This study aims to evaluate the European Patient Summary guidelines and their implementations, specifically the HL7 FHIR International Patient Summary Implementation Guide, to determine their suitability for secondary use in clinical research. The focus is on identifying gaps and extensions needed to enhance the utility of the European Patient Summary for building artificial intelligence models in assisting heart failure management. RESULTS: We selected two European Union-funded research projects, DataTools4Heart and AI4HF, that aim to reuse electronic health record data to develop artificial intelligence models for personalized decision support services for heart failure patients. We analyzed their clinical use cases and the specific data items required, and we compared these with the current European Patient Summary guidelines and provided a detailed gap analysis indicating similarities and required extensions. In our gap analysis, we also compared the needs of DataTools4Heart and AI4HF with the HL7 FHIR International Patient Summary Implementation Guide to assess the extensions needed to support clinical research. DISCUSSION: The EHDS is a transformative initiative to establish a European health data ecosystem that supports healthcare delivery and clinical research. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that, with minor extensions, these guidelines have significant potential to facilitate access to electronic healthcare record data for the secondary use, particularly in training AI models.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 2014, 2018, and 2023 data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey IT Supplement to measure differences in adoption rates (ie, the "adoption gap") of patient engagement and clinical data analytics functionalities across CAHs and non-CAHs. We measured changes over time in CAH and non-CAH adoption of 6 "core" clinical data analytics functionalities, 5 "core" patient engagement functionalities, 5 new patient engagement functionalities, and 3 bulk data export use cases. We constructed 2 composite measures for core functionalities and analyzed adoption for other functionalities individually. RESULTS: Core functionality adoption increased from 21% of CAHs in 2014 to 56% in 2023 for clinical data analytics and 18% to 49% for patient engagement. The CAH adoption gap in both domains narrowed from 2018 to 2023 (both P < .01). More than 90% of all hospitals had adopted viewing and downloading electronic data and clinical notes by 2023. The largest CAH adoption gaps in 2023 were for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) bulk export use cases (eg, analytics and reporting: 63% of CAHs, 81% of non-CAHs, P < .001). DISCUSSION: Adoption of advanced electronic health record functionalities has increased for CAHs and non-CAHs, and some adoption gaps have been closed since 2018. However, CAHs may continue to struggle with clinical data analytics and FHIR-based functionalities.

This article reports on the portion of the project focused on long COVID and presents the process of identifying and modeling data elements using the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Critical data elements for managing long COVID were defined through a consensus-driven approach involving a Technical Expert Panel (TEP). This involved 2 stages: identifying data concepts and establishing electronic exchange standards. RESULTS: The TEP-identified and -approved long COVID data elements were mapped to the HL7 US Core FHIR profiles for syntactic representation, and value sets from standard code systems were developed for semantic representation of the long COVID concepts. DISCUSSION: Establishing common long COVID data standards through this process, and representing them with the HL7 FHIR standard, facilitates interoperable data collection, benefiting care delivery and patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) for long COVID. These standards may support initiatives including clinical and pragmatic trials, quality improvement, epidemiologic research, and clinical and social interventions.By building standards-based data collection, this effort accelerates the development of evidence to better understand and deliver effective long COVID interventions and patient and caregiver priorities within the context of MCCs and to advance the delivery of coordinated, person-centered care. CONCLUSION: The open, collaborative, and consensus-based approach used in this project will enable the sharing of long COVID-related health concerns, interventions, and outcomes for patient-centered care coordination across diverse clinical settings and will facilitate the use of real-world data for long COVID research.', 'CI': ['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Medical', 'Informatics Association 2024.'], 'FAU': ['Dolin, Gay', 'Saitwal, Himali', 'Bertodatti, Karen', 'Mueller, Savanah', 'Bierman, Arlene S', 'Suls, Jerry', 'Brandt, Katie', 'Camara, Djibril S', 'Leppry, Stephanie', 'Jones, Emma', 'Gallego, Evelyn', 'Carlson, Dave', 'Norton, Jenna'], 'AU': ['Dolin G', 'Saitwal H', 'Bertodatti K', 'Mueller S', 'Bierman AS', 'Suls J', 'Brandt K', 'Camara DS', 'Leppry S', 'Jones E', 'Gallego E', 'Carlson D', 'Norton J'], 'AD': ['Namaste Informatics, Gold Hill, OR 97525, United States.', 'EMI Advisors, Sugar Land, TX 77479, United States.', 'EMI Advisors, New York, NY 11023, United States.', 'EMI Advisors, Chester, MD 21619, United States.', 'Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Rockville, MD 20857, United States.', 'Institute for Health System Science, Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030, United States.', 'Frontotemporal Disorders Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, United States.', 'US Agency for International Development, Global Health Training, Advisory, and Support, Credence Management Solutions, LLC, Washington, DC 20004, United States.', 'Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Oakland, CA 94131, United States.', 'Research and Development, Allscripts Veradigm, Raleigh, NC 27165, United States.', 'EMI Advisors, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, United States.', 'Mountain Lotus WellBeing, LLC, Windsor, CO 80550, United States.', 'Division of Kidney, Urologic, & Hematologic Diseases, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), Bethesda, MD 20817, United States.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20240911', 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'JAMIA Open', 'JT': 'JAMIA open', 'JID': '101730643', 'PMC': 'PMC11519022', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)', 'USCDI', 'care planning', 'data standards', 'interoperability', 'long COVID'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this article.'], 'EDAT': '2024/10/30 10:28', 'MHDA': '2024/10/30 10:29', 'PMCR': ['2024/09/11'], 'CRDT': ['2024/10/30 04:40'], 'PHST': ['2024/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2024/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2024/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2024/10/30 10:29 [medline]', '2024/10/30 10:28 [pubmed]', '2024/10/30 04:40 [entrez]', '2024/09/11 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['ooae095 [pii]', '10.1093/jamiaopen/ooae095 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'JAMIA Open. 2024 Sep 11;7(3):ooae095. doi: 10.1093/jamiaopen/ooae095. eCollection 2024 Oct.'}

The Mirth Connect Server, an open-source communication server, offers, in addition to the exchange functionality, functions for simultaneous manipulation of data. The standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) has recently become increasingly prevalent in national health care systems. FHIR specifies its own standardized mechanisms for transforming data structures using StructureMaps and the FHIR mapping language (FML). OBJECTIVE: In this study, a generic approach is developed, which allows for the application of declarative mapping rules defined using FML in an exchangeable manner. A transformation engine is required to execute the mapping rules. METHODS: FHIR natively defines resources to support the conversion of instance data, such as an FHIR StructureMap. This resource encodes all information required to transform data from a source system to a target system. In our approach, this information is defined in an implementation-independent manner using FML. Once the mapping has been defined, executable Mirth channels are automatically generated from the resources containing the mapping in JavaScript format. These channels can then be deployed to the Mirth Connect Server. RESULTS: The resulting tool is called FML2Mirth, a Java-based transformer that derives Mirth channels from detailed declarative mapping rules based on the underlying StructureMaps. Implementation of the translate functionality is provided by the integration of a terminology server, and to achieve conformity with existing profiles, validation via the FHIR validator is built in. The system was evaluated for its practical use by transforming Labordatentrager version 2 (LDTv.2) laboratory results into Medical Information Object (Medizinisches Informationsobjekt) laboratory reports in accordance with the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians' specifications and into the HL7 (Health Level Seven) Europe Laboratory Report. The system could generate complex structures, but LDTv.2 lacks some information to fully comply with the specification. CONCLUSIONS: The tool for the auto-generation of Mirth channels was successfully presented. Our tests reveal the feasibility of using the complex structures of the mapping language in combination with a terminology server to transform instance data. Although the Mirth Server and the FHIR are well established in medical informatics, the combination offers space for more research, especially with regard to FML. Simultaneously, it can be stated that the mapping language still has implementation-related shortcomings that can be compensated by Mirth Connect as a base technology.", 'CI': ['(c) Jesse Kruse, Joshua Wiedekopf, Ann-Kristin Kock-Schoppenhauer, Andrea', 'Essenwanger, Josef Ingenerf, Hannes Ulrich.

OBJECTIVES:  We aimed to design and develop a standards-based digital care coordination platform to support closed-loop social services referrals between patients and social and health care providers and demonstrate the feasibility to screen, diagnose, plan, and complete interventions with selected patients in real settings. METHODS:  We partnered with community members to design the platform through Community Engagement Studios and with a Federally Qualified Health Center, Local Mental Health Authority, and Food Bank to determine the features and workflow requirements of the platform design. We customized currently available systems to use Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that could exchange information in real time across providers and participants. RESULTS:  The platform was successfully demonstrated through a pilot where patients were recruited in clinical settings and referred to a Food Bank that provided SNAP application assistance to study participants. We translated the requirements of the platform to national standards and required workflows of providers and patients. Study participants were notified electronically of the specific steps to follow to complete their SNAP applications while receiving support from specialists from the Food Bank. CONCLUSION:  The pilot demonstrated the feasibility of collecting granular social service referral information that can be used to better address gaps in social care.

Over the years, many research repositories and data standards have been created. One of these is the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, used by the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) to harmonize and standardize data across university hospitals in Germany. One of the first steps to make these data available is to allow researchers to create feasibility queries to determine the data availability for a specific research question. Given the heterogeneity of different query languages to access different data across and even within standards such as FHIR (eg, CQL and FHIR Search), creating an intermediate query syntax for feasibility queries reduces the complexity of query translation and improves interoperability across different research repositories and query languages. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the creation and implementation of an intermediate query syntax for feasibility queries and how it integrates into the federated German health research portal (Forschungsdatenportal Gesundheit) and the MII. METHODS: We analyzed the requirements for feasibility queries and the feasibility tools that are currently available in research repositories. Based on this analysis, we developed an intermediate query syntax that can be easily translated into different research repository-specific query languages. RESULTS: The resulting Clinical Cohort Definition Language (CCDL) for feasibility queries combines inclusion criteria in a conjunctive normal form and exclusion criteria in a disjunctive normal form, allowing for additional filters like time or numerical restrictions. The inclusion and exclusion results are combined via an expression to specify feasibility queries. We defined a JSON schema for the CCDL, generated an ontology, and demonstrated the use and translatability of the CCDL across multiple studies and real-world use cases.

Early recognition of individuals at risk can allow risk-reducing interventions that improve morbidity and mortality. Family health history applications that gather data directly from patients could alleviate barriers to risk assessment in the clinical appointment, such as lack of provider knowledge of genetics guidelines and limited time in the clinical appointment. New approaches allow linking these applications to patient health portals and their electronic health records (EHRs), offering an end-to-end solution for patient-input family history information and risk result clinical decision support for their provider. METHODS: We describe the design of the first large-scale evaluation of an EHR-integrable, patient-facing family history software platform based on the Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (SMART on FHIR) standard. In our study, we leverage an established implementation science framework to evaluate the success of our model to facilitate scalable, systematic risk assessment for hereditary cancers in diverse clinical environments in a large pragmatic study at two sites. We will also evaluate the success of the approach to improve the efficiency of downstream genetic counseling resulting from pre-counseling pedigree generation. CONCLUSIONS: Our research study will provide evidence regarding a new care delivery model that is scalable and sustainable for a variety of medical centers and clinics.

However, the limited functionality of current PHR systems has affected users' willingness to adopt them, leading to lower-than-expected usage rates. The HL7 (Health Level Seven) PHR System Functional Model (PHR-S FM) was proposed to address this issue, outlining all possible functionalities in PHR systems. Although the PHR-S FM provides a comprehensive theoretical framework, its practical effectiveness and applicability have not been fully explored. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to design and develop a tethered PHR prototype in accordance with the guidelines of the PHR-S FM. It sought to explore the feasibility of applying the PHR-S FM in PHR systems by comparing the prototype with the results of previous research. METHODS: The PHR-S FM profile was defined to meet broad clinical data management requirements based on previous research. We designed and developed a PHR prototype as a web application using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources R4 (FHIR) and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) coding system for interoperability and data consistency. We validated the prototype using the Synthea dataset, which provided realistic synthetic medical records. In addition, we compared the results produced by the prototype with those of previous studies to evaluate the feasibility and implementation of the PHR-S FM framework. RESULTS: The PHR prototype was developed based on the PHR-S FM profile. We verified its functionality by demonstrating its ability to synchronize data with the FHIR server, effectively managing and displaying various health data types. Validation using the Synthea dataset confirmed the prototype's accuracy, achieving 100% coverage across 1157 data items. A comparison with the findings of previous studies indicated the feasibility of implementing the PHR-S FM and highlighted areas for future research and improvements. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study offer valuable insights into the potential for practical application and broad adoption of the PHR-S FM in real-world health care settings.", 'CI': ['(c) Teng Cao, Zhi Chen, Masaharu Nakayama.

Secure sharing of such patient-generated data with physicians would enable close management of individual health trajectories, monitoring of risk factors, and asynchronous feedback. However, most remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems currently available are not fully integrated into hospital IT systems or lack a patient-centric design. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conceptualize and implement a user-friendly, reusable, interoperable, and secure RPM system incorporating asynchronous feedback mechanisms using a broadly available consumer wearable (Apple Watch). In addition, this study sought to evaluate factors influencing patient acceptance of such systems. METHODS: The RPM system requirements were established through focus group sessions. Subsequently, a system concept was designed and implemented using an iterative approach ensuring technical feasibility from the beginning. To assess clinical feasibility, the system was used as part of the activeDCM prospective randomized interventional study focusing on dilated cardiomyopathy. Each patient used the system for at least 12 months. The System Usability Scale was used to measure usability from a subjective patient perspective. In addition, an evaluation was conducted on the objective wearable interaction frequency as well as the completeness of transmitted data classified into sensor-based health data (SHD) and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Descriptive statistics using box plots and bootstrapped multiple linear regression with 95% CIs were used for evaluation analyzing the influence of age, sex, device experience, and intervention group membership. RESULTS: The RPM system comprised 4 interoperable components: patient devices, a data server, a data viewer, and a notification service. The system was evaluated with 95 consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (28/95, 29% female; mean age 50, SD 12 y) who completed the activeDCM study protocol. The system's app achieved a mean System Usability Scale score of 78 (SD 17), which was most influenced by device experience. In total, 87% (83/95) of the patients could integrate the use of the app well or very well into their daily routine, and 71% (67/95) saw a benefit of the RPM system for management of their health condition. On average, patients interacted with the wearable on 61% (SD 26%) of days enrolled in the study. SHD were available on average for 78% (SD 23%) of days, and PROM data were available on 64% (SD 27%) of weeks enrolled in the study. Wearable interaction frequency, SHD, and PROM completeness were most influenced by intervention group membership. CONCLUSIONS: Our results mark a first step toward integrating RPM systems based on a consumer wearable device for primary patient input into standardized clinical workflows. They can serve as a blueprint for creating a user-friendly, reusable, interoperable, and secure RPM system that can be integrated into patients' daily routines.", 'CI': ['(c)Reto Wettstein, Farbod

The approach enables improved interoperability, considering consent, privacy, security requirements, and the ability to adopt new business, regulative or jurisdictional policies. Additionally, it accommodates generative AI solutions for faster alignment with existing document-based policies, ensuring clear provenance.

Standardized data and well-defined relationships between data points are necessary to guarantee semantic interoperability. Using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for clinical data representation would be a practical methodology to enhance and accelerate interoperability and data availability for research. OBJECTIVE: This research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art and current landscape in FHIR-based data models and structures. In addition, we intend to identify and discuss the tools, resources, limitations, and other critical aspects mentioned in the selected research papers. METHODS: To ensure the extraction of reliable results, we followed the instructions of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. We analyzed the indexed articles in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, the ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. After identifying, extracting, and assessing the quality and relevance of the articles, we synthesized the extracted data to identify common patterns, themes, and variations in the use of FHIR-based data models and structures across different studies. RESULTS: On the basis of the reviewed articles, we could identify 2 main themes: dynamic (pipeline-based) and static data models. The articles were also categorized into health care use cases, including chronic diseases, COVID-19 and infectious diseases, cancer research, acute or intensive care, random and general medical notes, and other conditions. Furthermore, we summarized the important or common tools and approaches of the selected papers. These items included FHIR-based tools and frameworks, machine learning approaches, and data storage and security. The most common resource was "Observation" followed by "Condition" and "Patient." The limitations and challenges of developing data models were categorized based on the issues of data integration, interoperability, standardization, performance, and scalability or generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: FHIR serves as a highly promising interoperability standard for developing real-world health care apps. The implementation of FHIR modeling for electronic health record data facilitates the integration, transmission, and analysis of data while also advancing translational research and phenotyping. Generally, FHIR-based exports of local data repositories improve data interoperability for systems and data warehouses across different settings.

For exchanging medical data between information systems, the structural standard FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) has recently gained popularity. Regarding semantic interoperability, the reference terminology SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), as a semantic standard, allows for postcoordination, offering advantages over many other vocabularies. These postcoordinated expressions (PCEs) make SNOMED CT an expressive and flexible interlingua, allowing for precise coding of medical facts. However, this comes at the cost of increased complexity, as well as challenges in storage and processing. Additionally, the boundary between semantic (terminology) and structural (information model) standards becomes blurred, leading to what is known as the TermInfo problem. Although often viewed critically, the TermInfo overlap can also be explored for its potential benefits, such as enabling flexible transformation of parts of PCEs. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, an alternative solution for storing PCEs is presented, which involves combining them with the FHIR data model. Ultimately, all components of a PCE should be expressible solely through precoordinated concepts that are linked to the appropriate elements of the information model. METHODS: The approach involves storing PCEs decomposed into their components in alignment with FHIR resources. By utilizing the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to generate an OWL ClassExpression, and combining it with an external reasoner and semantic similarity measures, a precoordinated SNOMED CT concept that most accurately describes the PCE is identified as a Superconcept. In addition, the nonmatching attribute relationships between the Superconcept and the PCE are identified as the "Delta." Once SNOMED CT attributes are manually mapped to FHIR elements, FHIRPath expressions can be defined for both the Superconcept and the Delta, allowing the identified precoordinated codes to be stored within FHIR resources. RESULTS: A web application called PCEtoFHIR was developed to implement this approach. In a validation process with 600 randomly selected precoordinated concepts, the formal correctness of the generated OWL ClassExpressions was verified. Additionally, 33 PCEs were used for two separate validation tests. Based on these validations, it was demonstrated that a previously proposed semantic similarity calculation is suitable for determining the Superconcept. Additionally, the 33 PCEs were used to confirm the correct functioning of the entire approach. Furthermore, the FHIR StructureMaps were reviewed and deemed meaningful by FHIR experts. CONCLUSIONS: PCEtoFHIR offers services to decompose PCEs for storage within FHIR resources. When creating structure mappings for specific subdomains of SNOMED CT concepts (eg, allergies) to desired FHIR profiles, the use of SNOMED CT Expression Templates has proven highly effective. Domain experts can create templates with appropriate mappings, which can then be easily reused in a constrained manner by end users.', 'CI': ['(c)Tessa Ohlsen, Josef Ingenerf, Andrea Essenwanger, Cora Drenkhahn.

So far, its applicability has been demonstrated for selected research projects with limited data. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to design and implement a conceptual medical intelligence framework to leverage real-world care data for clinical decision-making. METHODS: A Python package for the use of multimodal FHIR data (FHIRPACK [FHIR Python Analysis Conversion Kit]) was developed and pioneered in 5 real-world clinical use cases, that is, myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes, sepsis, and prostate cancer. Patients were identified based on the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) codes, and outcomes were derived from laboratory tests, prescriptions, procedures, and diagnostic reports. Results were provided as browser-based dashboards. RESULTS: For 2022, a total of 1,302,988 patient encounters were analyzed. (1) Myocardial infarction: in 72.7% (261/359) of cases, medication regimens fulfilled guideline recommendations. (2) Stroke: out of 1277 patients, 165 received thrombolysis and 108 thrombectomy. (3) Diabetes: in 443,866 serum glucose and 16,180 glycated hemoglobin A(1c) measurements from 35,494 unique patients, the prevalence of dysglycemic findings was 39% (13,887/35,494). Among those with dysglycemia, diagnosis was coded in 44.2% (6138/13,887) of the patients. (4) Sepsis: In 1803 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the primarily isolated pathogen (773/2672, 28.9%) and piperacillin and tazobactam was the primarily prescribed antibiotic (593/1593, 37.2%). (5) PC: out of 54, three patients who received radical prostatectomy were identified as cases with prostate-specific antigen persistence or biochemical recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging FHIR data through large-scale analytics can enhance health care quality and improve patient outcomes across 5 clinical specialties. We identified (1) patients with sepsis requiring less broad antibiotic therapy, (2) patients with myocardial infarction who could benefit from statin and antiplatelet therapy, (3) patients who had a stroke with longer than recommended times to intervention, (4) patients with hyperglycemia who could benefit from specialist referral, and (5) patients with PC with early increases in cancer markers.', 'CI': ['(c)Alexander Brehmer, Christopher Martin Sauer, Jayson Salazar Rodriguez, Kelsey', 'Herrmann, Moon Kim, Julius Keyl, Fin Hendrik Bahnsen, Benedikt Frank, Martin', 'Kohrmann, Tienush Rassaf, Amir-Abbas Mahabadi, Boris Hadaschik, Christopher Darr,', 'Ken Herrmann, Susanne Tan, Jan Buer, Thorsten Brenner, Hans Christian Reinhardt,', 'Felix Nensa, Michael Gertz, Jan Egger, Jens Kleesiek.

As part of the Medical Informatics Initiative, the local data integration centre is responsible for the accessibility of routine care data for medical research. Following the core data set, international interoperability standards such as FHIR and the English-language medical terminology SNOMED CT are used to create harmonised data. To represent each non-numeric laboratory test result within the base module profile ObservationLab, the need for a map and supporting tooling arose. STATE OF THE ART: Due to the requirement of a n:n map and a data safety-compliant local instance, publicly available tools (e.g., SNAP2SNOMED) were insufficient. Concept and Implementation: Therefore, we developed (1) an incremental mapping-validation process with different iteration cycles and (2) a customised mapping tool via Microsoft Access.

To identify suitable, biomarker-based trials for patients' clinicians need to screen multiple clinical trial registries which lack support for modern trial designs and offer only limited options to filter for in- and exclusion criteria. Several registries provide trial information but are limited regarding factors like timeliness, quality of information and capability for semantic, terminology enhanced searching for aspects like specific inclusion criteria. METHODS: We specified a Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resources (FHIR) Implementation Guide (IG) to represent clinical trials and their meta data. We embedded it into a community driven approach to maintain clinical trial data, which is fed by openly available data sources and later annotated by platform users. A governance model was developed to manage community contributions and responsibilities. RESULTS: We implemented Community Annotated Trial Search (CATS), an interactive platform for clinical trials for the scientific community with an open and interoperable information model. It provides a base to collaboratively annotate clinical trials and serves as a comprehensive information source for community members. Its terminology driven annotations are coined towards precision oncology, but its principles can be transferred to other contexts. CONCLUSION: It is possible to use the FHIR standard and an open-source information model represented in our IG to build an open, interoperable clinical trial register. Advanced features like user suggestions and audit trails of individual resource fields could be represented by extending the FHIR standard. CATS is the first implementation of an open-for-collaboration clinical trial registry with modern oncological trial designs and machine-to-machine communication in mind and its methodology could be extended to other medical fields besides precision oncology.

Digital medical interview assistants aim to facilitate the collection of health information. In this paper, we propose leveraging conversational agents to realize a medical interview assistant to facilitate medical history taking, while at the same time offering patients the opportunity to ask questions on the examination. METHODS: MIA, the digital medical interview assistant, was developed using a person-based design approach, involving patient opinions and expert knowledge during the design and development with a specific use case in collecting information before a mammography examination. MIA consists of two modules: the interview module and the question answering module (Q&A). To ensure interoperability with clinical information systems, we use HL7 FHIR to store and exchange the results collected by MIA during the patient interaction. The system was evaluated according to an existing evaluation framework that covers a broad range of aspects related to the technical quality of a conversational agent including usability, but also accessibility and security. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients recruited from two Swiss hospitals (Lindenhof group and Inselspital, Bern) and two patient organizations conducted the usability test. MIA was favorably received by the participants, who particularly noted the clarity of communication. However, there is room for improvement in the perceived quality of the conversation, the information provided, and the protection of privacy. The Q&A module achieved a precision of 0.51, a recall of 0.87 and an F-Score of 0.64 based on 114 questions asked by the participants. Security and accessibility also require improvements.

Data were collected on paper and transferred to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. These activities are challenging because there are no standards for data collection. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced a standard for health data collection during disasters for emergency medical teams (EMTs) in the form of a minimum dataset (MDS). Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia launched the SATUSEHAT platform to integrate all electronic medical records in Indonesia based on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to implement the WHO EMT MDS to create a disaster profile for the SATUSEHAT platform using FHIR. METHODS: We extracted variables from 2 EMT MDS medical records-the WHO and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) versions-and the daily reporting form. We then performed a mapping process to match these variables with the FHIR resources and analyzed the gaps between the variables and base resources. Next, we conducted profiling to see if there were any changes in the selected resources and created extensions to fill the gap using the Forge application. Subsequently, the profile was implemented using an open-source FHIR server. RESULTS: The total numbers of variables extracted from the WHO EMT MDS, ASEAN EMT MDS, and daily reporting forms were 30, 32, and 46, with the percentage of variables matching FHIR resources being 100% (30/30), 97% (31/32), and 85% (39/46), respectively. From the 40 resources available in the FHIR ID core, we used 10, 14, and 9 for the WHO EMT MDS, ASEAN EMT MDS, and daily reporting form, respectively. Based on the gap analysis, we found 4 variables in the daily reporting form that were not covered by the resources. Thus, we created extensions to address this gap. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully created a disaster profile that can be used as a disaster case for the SATUSEHAT platform. This profile may standardize health data collection during disasters.', 'CI': ['(c) Hiro Putra Faisal, Masaharu Nakayama.

The EHDS regulation will also accelerate the use of health data for research, innovation, policy-making, and regulatory activities for secondary use of data (known as EHDS2). The Integration of heterogeneous Data and Evidence towards Regulatory and HTA Acceptance (IDERHA) project builds one of the first pan-European health data spaces in alignment with the EHDS2 requirements, addressing lung cancer as a pilot. METHODS: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review of the EHDS regulation, technical requirements for EHDS2, and related projects. We also explored the results of the Joint Action Towards the European Health Data Space (TEHDAS) to identify the framework of IDERHA's alignment with EHDS2. We also conducted an internal webinar and an external workshop with EHDS experts to share expertise on the EHDS requirements and challenges. RESULTS: We identified the lessons learned from the existing projects and the minimum-set of requirements for aligning IDERHA infrastructure with EHDS2, including user journey, concepts, terminologies, and standards. The IDERHA framework (i.e., platform architecture, standardization approaches, documentation, etc.) is being developed accordingly. DISCUSSION: The IDERHA's alignment plan with EHDS2 necessitates the implementation of three categories of standardization for: data discoverability: Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT-AP), enabling semantics interoperability: Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP), and health data exchange (DICOM and FHIR). The main challenge is that some standards are still being refined, e.g., the extension of the DCAT-AP (HealthDCAT-AP). Additionally, extensions to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to represent the patient-generated health data are still needed. Finally, proper mapping between standards (FHIR/OMOP) is a prerequisite for proper data exchange. CONCLUSIONS: The IDERHA's plan and our collaboration with other EHDS initiatives/projects are critical in advancing the implementation of EHDS2.", 'CI': ['Copyright: (c) 2024 Hussein R et al.'], 'FAU': ['Hussein, Rada', 'Balaur, Irina', 'Burmann, Anja', 'Cwiek-Kupczynska, Hanna', 'Gadiya, Yojana', 'Ghosh, Soumyabrata', 'Jayathissa, Prabath', 'Katsch, Florian', 'Kremer, Andreas', 'Lahteenmaki, Jaakko', 'Meng, Zhaoling', 'Morasek, Kathrin', 'C Rancourt, Rebecca', 'Satagopam, Venkata', 'Sauermann, Stefan', 'Scheider, Simon', 'Stamm, Tanja', 'Muehlendyck, Christian', 'Gribbon, Philip'], 'AU': ['Hussein R', 'Balaur I', 'Burmann A', 'Cwiek-Kupczynska H', 'Gadiya Y', 'Ghosh S', 'Jayathissa P', 'Katsch F', 'Kremer A', 'Lahteenmaki J', 'Meng Z', 'Morasek K', 'C Rancourt R', 'Satagopam V', 'Sauermann S', 'Scheider S', 'Stamm T', 'Muehlendyck C', 'Gribbon P'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0003-3056-503X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3671-895X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6989-1230', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9113-567X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7683-0452', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7952-9326', 'ORCID: 0009-0001-0037-5051', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2696-7220'], 'AD': ['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Digital Health and Prevention, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biology, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Software and Systems Engineering, Dortmund, Germany.', 'Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biology, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Discovery Research ScreeningPort, Fraunhofer Institute for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence for Immune-Mediated Diseases (CIMD), Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Bonn-Aachen International Center for Information Technology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biology, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Digital Health and Prevention, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Digital Health and Prevention, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Institute of Medical Information Management, Center for Medical Data Science, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Outcomes Research, Center for Medical Data Science, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'ITTM S.A, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, Espoo, Finland.', 'Clinical Modeling and Evidence Integration, Sanofi, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Institute of Outcomes Research, Center for Medical Data Science, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Arthritis and Rehabilitation, Vienna, Austria.', 'Medical School Berlin, Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biology, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Faculty Life Science Engineering, FH Technikum Wien, Vienna, Austria.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Software and Systems Engineering, Dortmund, Germany.', 'Chair for Industrial Information Management, TU Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany.', 'Institute of Outcomes Research, Center for Medical Data Science, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Arthritis and Rehabilitation, Vienna, Austria.', 'Johnson & Johnson Medical GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany.', 'Discovery Research ScreeningPort, Fraunhofer Institute for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence for Immune-Mediated Diseases (CIMD), Frankfurt, Germany.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20240730', 'PL': 'Belgium', 'TA': 'Open Res Eur', 'JT': 'Open research Europe', 'JID': '9918230081006676', 'PMC': 'PMC11342032', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Artificial Intelligence; European health data space; cancer', 'digital health; healthcare standards; interoperability; secondary use of data.'], 'COIS': ['No competing interests were disclosed.'], 'EDAT': '2024/08/26 12:42', 'MHDA': '2024/08/26 12:43', 'PMCR': ['2024/07/30'], 'CRDT': ['2024/08/26 05:17'], 'PHST': ['2024/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2024/08/26 12:43 [medline]', '2024/08/26 12:42 [pubmed]', '2024/08/26 05:17 [entrez]', '2024/07/30 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['10.12688/openreseurope.18179.1 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Open Res Eur. 2024 Jul 30;4:160. doi: 10.12688/openreseurope.18179.1. eCollection 2024.'}

Our objective was to build up a REST Webservices alert engine that receives clinical parameters from patients of vital signs and basic laboratories to monitor patients remotely. We built a REST API using FHIR, so it can interoperate with other applications, send data to be processed, and receive a response. If the API detects a health risk situation, it sends an alert about the medical parameters that are controlled. The results of the processed data, news and alert, can return synchronously or asynchronously, at the same time that the data to be processed is being sent. The alerts generated can be automatically sent to a web service, mail or WhatsApp of the physician. The alert message comes out as normal, low, medium and high risk. The presented approach establishes communication that enables timely health information exchange. We conducted an experiment (with fictitious data) where we sent several queries by Postman. Finally, we evaluated the communication to be successful by manual checking. The use of the API significantly improves the monitoring of chronic patients.

The Medical Data Integration Center (MeDIC) of the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, resulting from the Medical Informatics Initiative and Network University Medicine in Germany, has agreed on an openEHR-based data management based on a centralized repository with harmonized annotated data. Consequently, the oncological data should be integrated into the MeDIC to interconnect the information and thus gain added value. A uniform national data set for tumor-related reports is already defined for the cancer registries. Therefore, this work aims to transform the national oncological basis data set for tumor documentation (oBDS) so that it can be stored and utilized properly in the openEHR repository of the MeDIC. In a previous work openEHR templates representing the oncological basis data set were modeled. These templates were used to implement a processing pipeline including a metadata repository, which defines the mappings between the elements, a FHIR terminology service for annotation and validation, resulting in a tool to automatically build openEHR compositions from oBDS data. The prototype proved the feasibility of the referred mapping, integration into the MeDIC is straightforward and the architecture introduced is adaptable to future needs by design.', 'FAU': ['Schladetzky, Jan', 'Reimer, Niklas', 'Nicolaus, Herwig', 'Busch, Hauke', 'Schreiweis, Bjorn', 'Kock-Schoppenhauer, Ann-Kristin'], 'AU': ['Schladetzky J', 'Reimer N', 'Nicolaus H', 'Busch H', 'Schreiweis B', 'Kock-Schoppenhauer AK'], 'AD': ['Medical Data Integration Center, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.', 'IT Center for Clinical Research, Lubeck, Universitat zu Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Schleswig-Holstein, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Medical Data Integration Center, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Schleswig-Holstein, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Medical Systems Biology Group, Lubeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, Universitat zu Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'IT Center for Clinical Research, Lubeck, Universitat zu Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Schleswig-Holstein, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Medical Systems Biology Group, Lubeck Institute of Experimental Dermatology, Universitat zu Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Medical Data Integration Center, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Statistics, Kiel University and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.', 'Medical Data Integration Center, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.', 'IT Center for Clinical Research, Lubeck, Universitat zu Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Schleswig-Holstein, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Lubeck, Germany.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'PL': 'Netherlands', 'TA': 'Stud Health Technol Inform', 'JT': 'Studies in health technology and informatics', 'JID': '9214582', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Humans', 'Germany', '*Neoplasms/therapy', 'Medical Oncology', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Medical Record Linkage/methods', 'Biomedical Research'], 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['cancer epidemiology', 'data integration', 'data management', 'health information interoperability', 'registries'], 'EDAT': '2024/08/23 06:41', 'MHDA': '2024/08/23 06:42', 'CRDT': ['2024/08/23 05:04'], 'PHST': ['2024/08/23 06:42 [medline]', '2024/08/23 06:41 [pubmed]', '2024/08/23 05:04 [entrez]'], 'AID': ['SHTI240655 [pii]', '10.3233/SHTI240655 [doi]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Stud Health Technol Inform. 2024 Aug 22;316:1319-1323. doi: 10.3233/SHTI240655.'}

This study showcases the integration of a FHIR layer into GameBus, a gamified health platform, aiming to enhance its interoperability. Traditionally, GameBus has relied on proprietary data schemas and REST APIs, which restricted data exchange with other platforms. The incorporation of the FHIR standard significantly mitigates these constraints. The FHIR layer, constructed with open-source technologies - including the Google HCLS Data Harmonization tool for data transformation and the HAPI FHIR framework for RESTful services - allows GameBus to engage in data sharing using standardized FHIR formats and APIs. Implemented as a standalone microservice, this layer requires no alterations to the pre-existing architecture of GameBus.

METHODS: We propose a declarative language to define the extraction of AI-ready datasets from health data adhering to a common data model, particularly those conforming to HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). We utilize the FHIR profiling to develop a common data model tailored to an AI use case to enable the explicit declaration of the needed information such as phenotype and AI feature definitions. In our pipeline model, we convert complex, high-dimensional electronic health records data represented with irregular time series sampling to a flat structure by defining a target population, feature groups and final datasets. Our design considers the requirements of various AI use cases from different projects which lead to implementation of many feature types exhibiting intricate temporal relations. RESULTS: We implement a scalable and high-performant feature repository to execute the data preparation pipeline definitions. This software not only ensures reliable, fault-tolerant distributed processing to produce AI-ready datasets and their metadata including many statistics alongside, but also serve as a pluggable component of a decision support application based on a trained AI model during online prediction to automatically prepare feature values of individual entities. We deployed and tested the proposed methodology and the implementation in three different research projects. We present the developed FHIR profiles as a common data model, feature group definitions and feature definitions within a data preparation pipeline while training an AI model for "predicting complications after cardiac surgeries". DISCUSSION: Through the implementation across various pilot use cases, it has been demonstrated that our framework possesses the necessary breadth and flexibility to define a diverse array of features, each tailored to specific temporal and contextual criteria.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2024 Namli, Sinaci, Gonul, Herguido, Garcia-Canadilla, Munoz, Esteve', 'and Erturkmen.'], 'FAU': ['Namli, Tuncay', 'Anil Sinaci, Ali', 'Gonul, Suat', 'Herguido, Cristina Ruiz', 'Garcia-Canadilla, Patricia', 'Munoz, Adriana Modrego', 'Esteve, Arnau Valls', 'Erturkmen, Gokce Banu Laleci'], 'AU': ['Namli T', 'Anil Sinaci A', 'Gonul S', 'Herguido CR', 'Garcia-Canadilla P', 'Munoz AM', 'Esteve AV', 'Erturkmen GBL'], 'AD': ['SRDC Software Research Development and Consultancy A.

However, according to German data protection regulations, data can often not leave the individual institutions and decentralized approaches are needed. Decentralized studies face challenges regarding coordination, technical infrastructure, interoperability and regulatory compliance. Rare diseases are an important prototype research focus for decentralized data analyses, as patients are rare by definition and adequate cohort sizes can only be reached if data from multiple sites is combined. METHODS: Within the project "Collaboration on Rare Diseases", decentralized studies focusing on four rare diseases (cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, Kawasaki disease, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children) were conducted at 17 German university hospitals. Therefore, a data management process for decentralized studies was developed by an interdisciplinary team of experts from medicine, public health and data science. Along the process, lessons learned were formulated and discussed. RESULTS: The process consists of eight steps and includes sub-processes for the definition of medical use cases, script development and data management. The lessons learned include on the one hand the organization and administration of the studies (collaboration of experts, use of standardized forms and publication of project information), and on the other hand the development of scripts and analysis (dependency on the database, use of standards and open source tools, feedback loops, anonymization).

The data ingestion procedure was successfully applied by the data provider (Hospital Clinico de la Universidad de Chile, HCUCH) using a pseudo-anonymization algorithm at the source, thereby ensuring that the privacy of patients' sensitive data is respected. Data transfer was carried out using international communication standards for health systems, which allows for replication of the procedure by other institutions that provide medical images. OBJECTIVES: This article aims to create a repository of 33,000 medical CT images and 33,000 diagnostic reports with international standards (HL7 HAPI FHIR, DICOM, SNOMED). This goal requires devising a data ingestion procedure that can be replicated by other provider institutions, guaranteeing data privacy by implementing a pseudo-anonymization algorithm at the source, and generating labels from annotations via NLP. METHODOLOGY: Our approach involves hybrid on-premise/cloud deployment of PACS and FHIR services, including transfer services for anonymized data to populate the repository through a structured ingestion procedure. We used NLP over the diagnostic reports to generate annotations, which were then used to train ML algorithms for content-based similar exam recovery.

High-quality biosamples linked to clinical data, stored in biobanks are essential for biomedical research. We aimed to facilitate the findability of these biosamples and their associated data. Networks of biobanks provide access to even larger pools of samples and data even from rare diseases and small disease subgroups. The German Biobank Alliance (GBA) established in 2017 under the umbrella of the German Biobank Node (GBN), has taken on the mission of a federated data discovery service to make biosamples and associated data available to researchers across Germany and Europe. METHODS: In this context, we identified the requirements of researchers seeking human biosamples from biobanks and the needs of biobanks for data sovereignty over their samples and data in conjunction with the sample donor's consent. Based on this, we developed a highly interoperable federated IT infrastructure using standards such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) and Clinical Quality Language (CQL). RESULTS: The infrastructure comprises two major components enabling federated real-time access to biosample metadata, allowing privacy-compliant queries and subsequent project requests. It has been in use since 2019, connecting 16 German academic biobanks, with additional European biobanks joining. In production since 2019 it has run 4941 queries over the span of one year on more than 900,000 biosamples collected from more than 170,000 donors. CONCLUSION: This infrastructure enhances the visibility and accessibility of biosamples for research, addressing the growing demand for human biosamples and associated data in research. It also underscores the need for improvements in processes beyond IT infrastructure, aiming to advance biomedical research and similar infrastructure development in other fields.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2024 The Authors.

However, integrating them into health information systems (HISs) introduces challenges beyond clinical decision making, such as interoperability and diverse electronic health records (EHR) formats. We proposed Model Cabinet Architecture (MoCab), a framework designed to leverage fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR) as the standard for data storage and retrieval when deploying machine learning models across various HISs, addressing the challenges highlighted by platforms such as EPOCH(R), ePRISM(R), KETOS, and others. METHODS: The MoCab architecture is designed to streamline predictive modeling in healthcare through a structured framework incorporating several specialized parts. The Data Service Center manages patient data retrieval from FHIR servers. These data are then processed by the Knowledge Model Center, where they are formatted and fed into predictive models. The Model Retraining Center is crucial in continuously updating these models to maintain accuracy in dynamic clinical environments. The framework further incorporates Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Hooks for issuing clinical alerts. It uses Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies (SMART) on FHIR to develop applications for displaying alerts, prediction results, and patient records. RESULTS: The MoCab framework was demonstrated using three types of predictive models: a scoring model (qCSI), a machine learning model (NSTI), and a deep learning model (SPC), applied to synthetic data that mimic a major EHR system. The implementations showed how MoCab integrates predictive models with health data for clinical decision support, utilizing CDS Hooks and SMART on FHIR for seamless HIS integration. The demonstration confirmed the practical utility of MoCab in supporting clinical decision making, validated by its application in various healthcare settings. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate MoCab's potential in promoting the interoperability of machine learning models and enhancing its utility across various EHRs. Despite facing challenges like FHIR adoption, MoCab addresses key challenges in adapting machine learning models within healthcare settings, paving the way for further enhancements and broader adoption.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2024 Elsevier B.V.

High-quality data is vital for an accurate representation of patient populations and to avoid erroneous healthcare decisions. However, existing studies have highlighted significant challenges in EHR data quality, necessitating innovative tools and methodologies for effective data quality assessment and improvement. OBJECTIVE: This article addresses the critical need for data quality evaluation in obstetrics by developing a novel tool. The tool utilizes Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resources (FHIR) standards in conjunction with Bayesian Networks and expert rules, offering a novel approach to assessing data quality in real-world obstetrics data. METHODS: A harmonized framework focusing on completeness, plausibility, and conformance underpins our methodology. We employed Bayesian networks for advanced probabilistic modeling, integrated outlier detection methods, and a rule-based system grounded in domain-specific knowledge. The development and validation of the tool were based on obstetrics data from 9 Portuguese hospitals, spanning the years 2019-2020. RESULTS: The developed tool demonstrated strong potential for identifying data quality issues in obstetrics EHRs. Bayesian networks used in the tool showed high performance for various features with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) between 75% and 97%. The tool's infrastructure and interoperable format as a FHIR Application Programming Interface (API) enables a possible deployment of a real-time data quality assessment in obstetrics settings. Our initial assessments show promised, even when compared with physicians' assessment of real records, the tool can reach AUROC of 88%, depending on the threshold defined. DISCUSSION: Our results also show that obstetrics clinical records are difficult to assess in terms of quality and assessments like ours could benefit from more categorical approaches of ranking between bad and good quality. CONCLUSION: This study contributes significantly to the field of EHR data quality assessment, with a specific focus on obstetrics. The combination of HL7-FHIR interoperability, machine learning techniques, and expert knowledge presents a robust, adaptable solution to the challenges of healthcare data quality. Future research should explore tailored data quality evaluations for different healthcare contexts, as well as further validation of the tool capabilities, enhancing the tool's utility across diverse medical domains.", 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2024.

The key feature of RTD is low delivery latency. Information systems in health care are extremely time-sensitive and their building block is the electronic health record (EHR). Real-time data from EHRs play an important role to support decision-making, analytics and coordination of care. This is well mentioned in the literature, but the process has not yet been described, providing reference implementations and testing. Real-time data delivery can technically be achieved using several methods. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of different transfer methods of RTD from EHRs by measuring delivery latency. METHODS: In our work we used four approaches to transfer RTD from EHRs: REST hooks, WebSocket notifications, reverse proxy and database triggers. We deployed a Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) server as it is one of the most widely used EHR standard. For the reference implementations we used Python and Golang. Delivery latency was selected as performance metric, derived by subtracting the timestamp of the EHR resource creation from the timestamp of the EHR resource receipt in millisecond. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, cumulative distribution function (CDF), Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc tests. RESULTS: The database trigger approach had the best mean delivery latency 13.52+/-5.56 ms, followed by the reverse proxy 14.43+/-4.58 ms, REST hooks 19.26+/-5.76 ms and WebSocket 27.32+/-9.44 ms. The reverse proxy showed a tighter range of the values and lower variability. There were significant differences in the latencies between all pairs of approaches, except for reverse proxy and database trigger. CONCLUSION: Real-time data transfer is vital for the development of robust and innovative healthcare applications. Properties of current EHR systems as a data source predefine the approaches for transfer. In our work for the first time the performance of RTD transfer from the EHRs with reference implementations is measured and evaluated. We found that database triggers achieve lowest delivery latency. Reverse proxy performed slightly slower, but offered more stability, followed by REST hooks and WebSocket notifications.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The German Medical Informatics Initiative, a collaboration of 37 university hospitals in Germany, aims to enable interoperability between partner sites by defining Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) profiles for the cross-institutional exchange of health care data, the Core Data Set (CDS). The current CDS and its extension modules define elements representing patients' health care records. All university hospitals in Germany have made significant progress in providing routine data in a standardized format based on the CDS. In addition, the central research platform for health, the German Portal for Medical Research Data feasibility tool, allows medical researchers to query the available CDS data items across many participating hospitals. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to evaluate a novel approach of combining the current top-down generated FHIR profiles with the bottom-up generated knowledge gained by the analysis of respective instance data. This allowed us to derive options for iteratively refining FHIR profiles using the information obtained from a discrepancy analysis. METHODS: We developed an FHIR validation pipeline and opted to derive more restrictive profiles from the original CDS profiles. This decision was driven by the need to align more closely with the specific assumptions and requirements of the central feasibility platform's search ontology. While the original CDS profiles offer a generic framework adaptable for a broad spectrum of medical informatics use cases, they lack the specificity to model the nuanced criteria essential for medical researchers. A key example of this is the necessity to represent specific laboratory codings and values interdependencies accurately. The validation results allow us to identify discrepancies between the instance data at the clinical sites and the profiles specified by the feasibility platform and addressed in the future. RESULTS: A total of 20 university hospitals participated in this study. Historical factors, lack of harmonization, a wide range of source systems, and case sensitivity of coding are some of the causes for the discrepancies identified. While in our case study, Conditions, Procedures, and Medications have a high degree of uniformity in the coding of instance data due to legislative requirements for billing in Germany, we found that laboratory values pose a significant data harmonization challenge due to their interdependency between coding and value. CONCLUSIONS: While the CDS achieves interoperability, different challenges for federated data access arise, requiring more specificity in the profiles to make assumptions on the instance data. We further argue that further harmonization of the instance data can significantly lower required retrospective harmonization efforts. We recognize that discrepancies cannot be resolved solely at the clinical site; therefore, our findings have a wide range of implications and will require action on multiple levels and by various stakeholders.", 'CI': ['(c)Lorenz Rosenau, Paul Behrend, Joshua Wiedekopf, Julian Gruendner, Josef', 'Ingenerf.

In the United States, using RWD for postmarket surveillance has been hindered by the inability to exchange clinical data between healthcare providers and public health organizations in an interoperable format. However, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) has recently enacted regulation requiring all healthcare providers to support seamless access, exchange, and use of electronic health information through the interoperable HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. To leverage the recent ONC changes, BEST designed a pilot platform to query and receive the clinical information necessary to analyze suspected AEs. This study assessed the feasibility of using the RWD received through the data exchange of FHIR resources to study post-vaccination AE cases by evaluating the data volume, query response time, and data quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used RWD from 283 post-vaccination AE cases, which were received through the platform. We used descriptive statistics to report results and apply 322 data quality tests based on a data quality framework for EHR. RESULTS: The volume analysis indicated the average clinical resources for a post-vaccination AE case was 983.9 for the median partner. The query response time analysis indicated that cases could be received by the platform at a median of 3 min and 30 s. The quality analysis indicated that most of the data elements and conformance requirements useful for postmarket surveillance were met.

To address this, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) Implementation Guide (IG) standardizes the information exchange among these systems, considering a specific context of use. OBJECTIVE: Develop an FHIR IG for stroke care rooted in established stroke CP and VBHC principles. METHOD: We represented the stroke patient journey by considering the core stroke CP, the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) dataset for stroke, and a Brazilian case study using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Next, we developed a data dictionary that aligns variables with existing FHIR resources and adapts profiling from the Brazilian National Health Data Network (BNHDN). RESULTS: Our BPMN model encompassed three critical phases that represent the entire patient journey from symptom onset to rehabilitation. The stroke data dictionary included 81 variables, which were expressed as questionnaires, profiles, and extensions. The FHIR IG comprised nine pages: Home, Stroke-CP, Data Dictionary, FHIR, ICHOM, Artifacts, Examples, Downloads, and Security. We developed 96 artifacts, including 7 questionnaires, 27 profiles with corresponding example instances, 3 extensions, 18 value sets, and 14 code systems pertinent to ICHOM outcome measures.

BACKGROUND: The ADLIFE project aims to develop innovative, digital health solutions to support personalized, integrated care for patients with severe long-term conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, and/or Chronic Heart Failure. Successful long-term management of patients with chronic conditions requires active patient self-management and a proactive involvement of patients in their healthcare and treatment. This calls for a patient-provider partnership within an integrated system of collaborative care, supporting self-management, shared-decision making, collection of patient reported outcome measures, education, and follow-up. METHODS: ADLIFE follows an outcome-based and patient-centered approach where PROMs represent an especially valuable tool to evaluate the outcomes of the care delivered. We have selected 11 standardized PROMs for evaluating the most recent patients\' clinical context, enabling the decision-making process, and personalized care planning. The ADLIFE project implements the "SHARE approach\' for enabling shared decision-making via two digital platforms for healthcare professionals and patients. We have successfully integrated PROMs and shared decision-making processes into our digital toolbox, based on an international interoperability standard, namely HL7 FHIR. A usability study was conducted with 3 clinical sites with 20 users in total to gather feedback and to subsequently prioritize updates to the ADLIFE toolbox. RESULTS: User satisfaction is measured in the QUIS7 questionnaire on a 9-point scale in the following aspects: overall reaction, screen, terminology and tool feedback, learning, multimedia, training material and system capabilities. With all the average scores above 6 in all categories, most respondents have a positive reaction to the ADLIFE PEP platform and find it easy to use. We have identified shortcomings and have prioritized updates to the platform before clinical pilot studies are initiated. CONCLUSIONS: Having finalized design, implementation, and pre-deployment usability studies, and updated the tool based on further feedback, our patient empowerment mechanisms enabled via PROMs and shared decision-making processes are ready to be piloted in clinal settings. Clinical studies will be conducted based at six healthcare settings across Spain, UK, Germany, Denmark, and Israel.', 'CI': ['(c) 2024.

To test the interoperability within the field of oncology research, our team at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) enabled our Epic-based EHR to be compatible with the Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE), which is a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based consensus data standard created to facilitate the transmission of EHRs for patients with cancer. METHODS: Our approach used an extract, transform, load tool for converting EHR data from the VUMC Epic Clarity database into mCODE-compatible profiles. We established a sandbox environment on Microsoft Azure for data migration, deployed a FHIR server to handle application programming interface (API) requests, and mapped VUMC data to align with mCODE structures. In addition, we constructed a web application to demonstrate the practical use of mCODE profiles in health care. RESULTS: We developed an end-to-end pipeline that converted EHR data into mCODE-compliant profiles, as well as a web application that visualizes genomic data and provides cancer risk assessments. Despite the complexities of aligning traditional EHR databases with mCODE standards and the limitations of FHIR APIs in supporting advanced statistical methodologies, this project successfully demonstrates the practical integration of mCODE standards into existing health care infrastructures. CONCLUSION: This study provides a proof of concept for the interoperability of mCODE within a major health care institution's EHR system, highlighting both the potential and the current limitations of FHIR APIs in supporting complex data analysis for oncology research.", 'FAU': ['Li, Yanwei', 'Ye, Jiarong', 'Huang, Yuxin', 'Wu, Jiayi', 'Liu, Xiaohan', 'Ahmed, Shun', 'Osterman, Travis'], 'AU': ['Li Y', 'Ye J', 'Huang Y', 'Wu J', 'Liu X', 'Ahmed S', 'Osterman T'], 'AD': ['Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0009-0006-9602-0461', 'ORCID: 0009-0009-4167-1226', 'ORCID: 0009-0009-3744-045X', 'ORCID: 0009-0000-3979-0677', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2841-8121'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'GR': ['P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'JCO Clin Cancer Inform', 'JT': 'JCO clinical cancer informatics', 'JID': '101708809', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Humans', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Pilot Projects', '*Medical Oncology/methods/standards', '*Genomics/methods', '*Academic Medical Centers', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Common Data Elements', 'Software', 'Health Information Interoperability'], 'PMC': 'PMC11371088', 'COIS': ['The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this', 'manuscript.

There has not been a scalable and reusable computer-readable standard for distributing research results and synthesized evidence among creators, implementers, and the ultimate users of that evidence. Evidence that is more rapidly updated, synthesized, disseminated, and implemented would improve both the delivery of EBM and evidence-based health care policy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to introduce the EBM on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) project (EBMonFHIR), which is extending the methods and infrastructure of Health Level Seven (HL7) FHIR to provide an interoperability standard for the electronic exchange of health-related scientific knowledge. METHODS: As an ongoing process, the project creates and refines FHIR resources to represent evidence from clinical studies and syntheses of those studies and develops tools to assist with the creation and visualization of FHIR resources. RESULTS: The EBMonFHIR project created FHIR resources (ie, ArtifactAssessment, Citation, Evidence, EvidenceReport, and EvidenceVariable) for representing evidence. The COVID-19 Knowledge Accelerator (COKA) project, now Health Evidence Knowledge Accelerator (HEvKA), took this work further and created FHIR resources that express EvidenceReport, Citation, and ArtifactAssessment concepts. The group is (1) continually refining FHIR resources to support the representation of EBM; (2) developing controlled terminology related to EBM (ie, study design, statistic type, statistical model, and risk of bias); and (3) developing tools to facilitate the visualization and data entry of EBM information into FHIR resources, including human-readable interfaces and JSON viewers. CONCLUSIONS: EBMonFHIR resources in conjunction with other FHIR resources can support relaying EBM components in a manner that is interoperable and consumable by downstream tools and health information technology systems to support the users of evidence.', 'CI': ['(c)Andrey Soares, Lisa M Schilling, Joshua Richardson, Bhagvan Kommadi, Vignesh', 'Subbian, Joanne Dehnbostel, Khalid Shahin, Karen A Robinson, Muhammad Afzal,', 'Harold P Lehmann, Ilkka Kunnamo, Brian S Alper.

Despite the abundance of medical data across various facilities - including hospitals, outpatient clinics, and physician practices - the intersectoral exchange of information remains largely hindered due to differences in data structure, content, and adherence to data protection regulations. In response to this challenge, the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) was launched in Germany, focusing initially on university hospitals to foster the exchange and utilization of real-world data through the development of standardized methods and tools, including the creation of a common core dataset. Our aim, as part of the Medical Informatics Research Hub in Saxony (MiHUBx), is to extend the MII concepts to non-university healthcare providers in a more seamless manner to enable the exchange of real-world data among intersectoral medical sites. METHODS: We investigated what services are needed to facilitate the provision of harmonized real-world data for cross-site research. On this basis, we designed a Service Platform Prototype that hosts services for data harmonization, adhering to the globally recognized Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) international standard communication format and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). Leveraging these standards, we implemented additional services facilitating data utilization, exchange and analysis. Throughout the development phase, we collaborated with an interdisciplinary team of experts from the fields of system administration, software engineering and technology acceptance to ensure that the solution is sustainable and reusable in the long term. RESULTS: We have developed the pre-built packages "ResearchData-to-FHIR," "FHIR-to-OMOP," and "Addons," which provide the services for data harmonization and provision of project-related real-world data in both the FHIR MII Core dataset format (CDS) and the OMOP CDM format as well as utilization and a Service Platform Prototype to streamline data management and use. CONCLUSION: Our development shows a possible approach to extend the MII concepts to non-university healthcare providers to enable cross-site research on real-world data. Our Service Platform Prototype can thus pave the way for intersectoral data sharing, federated analysis, and provision of SMART-on-FHIR applications to support clinical decision making.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2024 Hoffmann, Nesterow, Peng, Henke, Barnett, Klengel, Gruhl,', 'Bartos, Nussler, Gebler, Grummt, Seim, Bathelt, Reinecke, Wolfien, Weidner and', 'Sedlmayr.'], 'FAU': ['Hoffmann, Katja', 'Nesterow, Igor', 'Peng, Yuan', 'Henke, Elisa', 'Barnett, Daniela', 'Klengel, Cigdem', 'Gruhl, Mirko', 'Bartos, Martin', 'Nussler, Frank', 'Gebler, Richard', 'Grummt, Sophia', 'Seim, Anne', 'Bathelt, Franziska', 'Reinecke, Ines', 'Wolfien, Markus', 'Weidner, Jens', 'Sedlmayr, Martin'], 'AU': ['Hoffmann K', 'Nesterow I', 'Peng Y', 'Henke E', 'Barnett D', 'Klengel C', 'Gruhl M', 'Bartos M', 'Nussler F', 'Gebler R', 'Grummt S', 'Seim A', 'Bathelt F', 'Reinecke I', 'Wolfien M', 'Weidner J', 'Sedlmayr M'], 'AD': ['Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Data Integration Center, Center for Medical Informatics, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Informatics, Klinikum Chemnitz gGmbH, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'Department of Informatics, Klinikum Chemnitz gGmbH, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Thiem-Research GmbH, Cottbus, Germany.', 'Data Integration Center, Center for Medical Informatics, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20240605', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Med (Lausanne)', 'JT': 'Frontiers in medicine', 'JID': '101648047', 'PMC': 'PMC11188485', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['data harmonization', 'health data space', 'interoperability', 'intersectoral data sharing', 'real-world data', 'research data infrastructure', 'secondary use of clinical data', 'service platform'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2024/06/21 06:42', 'MHDA': '2024/06/21 06:43', 'PMCR': ['2024/06/05'], 'CRDT': ['2024/06/21 04:24'], 'PHST': ['2024/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2024/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2024/06/21 06:43 [medline]', '2024/06/21 06:42 [pubmed]', '2024/06/21 04:24 [entrez]', '2024/06/05 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['10.3389/fmed.2024.1377209 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Front Med (Lausanne). 2024 Jun 5;11:1377209. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2024.1377209. eCollection 2024.'}

This allows radiologist-created report data to integrate with artificial intelligence-generated results for use throughout downstream systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a framework modeling radiology findings as Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) observations using CDE set/element identifiers as standardized semantic labels. This framework deploys CDE identifiers to specify radiology findings and attributes, providing consistent labels for radiology report concepts-diagnoses, recommendations, tabular/quantitative data-with built-in integration with RadLex, SNOMED CT, LOINC, and other ontologies. Observation structures fit within larger HL7 FHIR DiagnosticReport resources, providing output including both nuanced text and structured data. RESULTS: Labeling radiology findings as discrete data for interchange between systems requires two components: structure and semantics. CDE definitions provide semantic identifiers for findings and their component values. The FHIR observation resource specifies a structure for associating identifiers with radiology findings in the context of reports, with CDE-encoded observations referring to definitions for CDE identifiers in a central repository. The discussion includes an example of encoding pulmonary nodules on a chest CT as CDE-labeled observations, demonstrating the application of this framework to exchange findings throughout the imaging workflow, making imaging data available to downstream clinical systems. DISCUSSION: CDE-labeled observations establish a lingua franca for encoding, exchanging, and consuming radiology data at the level of individual findings, facilitating use throughout healthcare systems. IMPORTANCE: CDE-labeled FHIR observation objects can increase the value of radiology results by facilitating their use throughout patient care.', 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2024.

To do this, textual SOPs have to be transformed into operable clinical algorithms and linked to the data of the patient being treated. For this linkage, we need to know exactly which data are needed by clinicians at a certain decision point and whether these data are available. These data might be identical to the data used within the SOP or might integrate a broader view. To address these concerns, we examined if the data used by the SOP is also complete from the point of view of physicians for contextual decision-making. Methods: We selected a cohort of 67 patients with stage III melanoma who had undergone adjuvant treatment and mainly had an indication for a sentinel biopsy. First, we performed a step-by-step simulation of the patient treatment along our clinical algorithm, which is based on a hospital-specific SOP, to validate the algorithm with the given Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based data of our cohort. Second, we presented three different decision situations within our algorithm to 10 dermatooncologists, focusing on the concrete patient data used at this decision point. The results were conducted, analyzed, and compared with those of the pure algorithmic simulation. Results: The treatment paths of patients with melanoma could be retrospectively simulated along the clinical algorithm using data from the patients\' electronic health records. The subsequent evaluation by dermatooncologists showed that the data used at the three decision points had a completeness between 84.6% and 100.0% compared with the data used by the SOP. At one decision point, data on "patient age (at primary diagnosis)" and "date of first diagnosis" were missing. Conclusions: The data needed for our decision points are available in the FHIR-based dataset. Furthermore, the data used at decision points by the SOP and hence the clinical algorithm are nearly complete compared with the data required by physicians in clinical practice. This is an important precondition for further research focusing on presenting decision points within a treatment process integrated with the patient data needed.', 'FAU': ['Beckmann, Catharina Lena', 'Lodde, Georg', 'Swoboda, Jessica', 'Livingstone, Elisabeth', 'Bockmann, Britta'], 'AU': ['Beckmann CL', 'Lodde G', 'Swoboda J', 'Livingstone E', 'Bockmann B'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0001-7991-2587', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1683-7959', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8279-9239', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7498-7934'], 'AD': ['Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund (FH Dortmund), 44227 Dortmund, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Hospital Essen, 45147 Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, University Hospital Essen, Girardetstrasse 2, 45131 Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, University Hospital Essen, 45147 Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund (FH Dortmund), 44227 Dortmund, Germany.', 'Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, University Hospital Essen, Girardetstrasse 2, 45131 Essen, Germany.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20240606', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'J Clin Med', 'JT': 'Journal of clinical medicine', 'JID': '101606588', 'PMC': 'PMC11172530', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['BPMN', 'HL7 FHIR', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical pathways', 'computer-interpretable clinical guidelines', 'malignant melanoma', 'patient-specific modeling', 'point of care', 'real-world data', 'standard operating procedures'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2024/06/19 06:41', 'MHDA': '2024/06/19 06:42', 'PMCR': ['2024/06/06'], 'CRDT': ['2024/06/19 01:14'], 'PHST': ['2024/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2024/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2024/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2024/06/19 06:42 [medline]', '2024/06/19 06:41 [pubmed]', '2024/06/19 01:14 [entrez]', '2024/06/06 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['jcm13113353 [pii]', 'jcm-13-03353 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm13113353 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'J Clin Med. 2024 Jun 6;13(11):3353. doi: 10.3390/jcm13113353.'}

Digital healthcare ecosystems emerge to target increasing healthcare costs and invest in standard Application Programming Interfaces (API), such as HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) for trusted data flows. OBJECTIVES: This scoping review assessed the role and impact of HL7 FHIR and associated Implementation Guides (IGs) in digital healthcare ecosystems focusing on chronic disease management. METHODS: To study trends and developments relevant to HL7 FHIR, a scoping review of the scientific and gray English literature from 2017 to 2023 was used. RESULTS: The selection of 93 of 524 scientific papers reviewed in English indicates that the popularity of HL7 FHIR as a robust technical interface standard for the health sector has been steadily rising since its inception in 2010, reaching a peak in 2021. Digital Health applications use HL7 FHIR in cancer (45 %), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (more than 15 %), and diabetes (almost 15 %). The scoping review revealed that references to HL7 FHIR IGs are limited to  approximately  20 % of articles reviewed. HL7 FHIR R4 was most frequently referenced when the HL7 FHIR version was mentioned. In HL7 FHIR IGs registries and the internet, we found 35 HL7 FHIR IGs addressing chronic disease management, i.e., cancer (40 %), chronic disease management (25 %), and diabetes (20 %). HL7 FHIR IGs frequently complement the information in the article. CONCLUSIONS: HL7 FHIR matures with each revision of the standard as HL7 FHIR IGs are developed with validated data sets, common shared HL7 FHIR resources, and supporting tools. Referencing HL7 FHIR IGs cataloged in official registries and in scientific publications is recommended to advance data quality and facilitate mutual learning in growing digital healthcare ecosystems that nurture interoperability in digital health innovation.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2024 The Authors.

METHODS: We advance a model for scalable, federated, data sharing and learning. Cumulus software is designed to address key technology and policy desiderata including local utility, control, and administrative simplicity as well as privacy preservation during robust data sharing, and artificial intelligence (AI) for processing unstructured text. RESULTS: Cumulus relies on containerized, cloud-hosted software, installed within a healthcare organization\'s security envelope. Cumulus accesses EHR data via the Bulk FHIR interface and streamlines automated processing and sharing. The modular design enables use of the latest AI and natural language processing tools and supports provider autonomy and administrative simplicity. In an initial test, Cumulus was deployed across 5 healthcare systems each partnered with public health. Cumulus output is patient counts which were aggregated into a table stratifying variables of interest to enable population health studies. All code is available open source. A policy stipulating that only aggregate data leave the institution greatly facilitated data sharing agreements. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Cumulus addresses barriers to data sharing based on (1) federally required support for standard APIs, (2) increasing use of cloud computing, and (3) advances in AI.

Our goal is to empower multidisciplinary care teams to craft personalized holistic care plans while adhering to evidence-based guidelines. This necessitates the creation of clear specifications for clinical decision support (CDS) services, consolidating guidance from multiple evidence-based clinical guidelines. Thus, a co-creation approach involving both clinical and technical experts is essential. METHODS: This paper outlines a robust methodology for generating implementable specifications for CDS services to automate clinical guidelines. We have established a co-creation framework to facilitate collaborative exploration of clinical guidelines between clinical experts and software engineers. We have proposed an open, repeatable, and traceable method for translating evidence-based guideline narratives into implementable specifications of CDS services. Our approach, based on international standards such as CDS-Hooks and HL7 FHIR, enhances interoperability and potential adoption of CDS services across diverse healthcare systems. RESULTS: This methodology has been followed to create implementable specifications for 65 CDS services, automating CAREPATH consensus guideline consolidating guidance from 25 selected evidence-based guidelines. A total of 296 CDS rules have been formally defined, with input parameters defined as clinical concepts bound to FHIR resources and international code systems. Outputs include 346 well-defined CDS Cards, offering clear guidance for care plan activities and goal suggestions. These specifications have led to the implementation of 65 CDS services integrated into the CAREPATH Adaptive Integrated Care Platform. DISCUSSION: Our methodology offers a systematic, replicable process for generating CDS specifications, ensuring consistency and reliability across implementation. By fostering collaboration between clinical expertise and technical proficiency, we enhance the quality and relevance of generated specifications. Clear traceability enables stakeholders to track the development process and ensure adherence to guideline recommendations.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2024 Gencturk, Laleci Erturkmen, Akpinar, Pournik, Ahmad, Arvanitis,', 'Schmidt-Barzynski, Robbins, Alcantud Corcoles and Abizanda.'], 'FAU': ['Gencturk, Mert', 'Laleci Erturkmen, Gokce B', 'Akpinar, A Emre', 'Pournik, Omid', 'Ahmad, Bilal', 'Arvanitis, Theodoros N', 'Schmidt-Barzynski, Wolfgang', 'Robbins, Tim', 'Alcantud Corcoles, Ruben', 'Abizanda, Pedro'], 'AU': ['Gencturk M', 'Laleci Erturkmen GB', 'Akpinar AE', 'Pournik O', 'Ahmad B', 'Arvanitis TN', 'Schmidt-Barzynski W', 'Robbins T', 'Alcantud Corcoles R', 'Abizanda P'], 'AD': ['SRDC Software Research & Development and Consultancy Corporation, Ankara, Turkiye.', 'SRDC Software Research & Development and Consultancy Corporation, Ankara, Turkiye.', 'SRDC Software Research & Development and Consultancy Corporation, Ankara, Turkiye.', 'Department of Computer Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkiye.', 'Department of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Digital & Data Driven Research Unit, University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'University Hospital OWL, Bielefeld, Germany.', 'Digital & Data Driven Research Unit, University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry, United Kingdom.', 'Geriatrics Department, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Albacete, Spain.', 'CIBER de Fragilidad y Envejecimiento Saludable (CIBERFES), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Geriatrics Department, Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete, Albacete, Spain.', 'CIBER de Fragilidad y Envejecimiento Saludable (CIBERFES), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Facultad de Medicina de Albacete, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Albacete, Spain.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20240527', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Med (Lausanne)', 'JT': 'Frontiers in medicine', 'JID': '101648047', 'PMC': 'PMC11163046', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['HL7 FHIR', 'automation', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical guideline', 'dementia', 'integrated care', 'multimorbidity'], 'COIS': ['MG, GL, and AA are employed by Software Research & Development and Consultancy', 'Corporation.

This is particularly true for clinical studies that focus on infectious diseases. Public health may be highly dependent on the findings of such studies. Hence, there is an elevated urgency to generate meaningful, reliable insights, ideally based on a high sample number and quality data. The implementation of core data elements and the incorporation of interoperability standards can facilitate the creation of harmonized clinical data sets. OBJECTIVE: This study\'s objective was to compare, harmonize, and standardize variables focused on diagnostic tests used as part of CRFs in 6 international clinical studies of infectious diseases in order to, ultimately, then make available the panstudy common data elements (CDEs) for ongoing and future studies to foster interoperability and comparability of collected data across trials. METHODS: We reviewed and compared the metadata that comprised the CRFs used for data collection in and across all 6 infectious disease studies under consideration in order to identify CDEs. We examined the availability of international semantic standard codes within the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms, the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus, and the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes system for the unambiguous representation of diagnostic testing information that makes up the CDEs. We then proposed 2 data models that incorporate semantic and syntactic standards for the identified CDEs. RESULTS: Of 216 variables that were considered in the scope of the analysis, we identified 11 CDEs to describe diagnostic tests (in particular, serology and sequencing) for infectious diseases: viral lineage/clade; test date, type, performer, and manufacturer; target gene; quantitative and qualitative results; and specimen identifier, type, and collection date. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of CDEs for infectious diseases is the first step in facilitating the exchange and possible merging of a subset of data across clinical studies (and with that, large research projects) for possible shared analysis to increase the power of findings. The path to harmonization and standardization of clinical study data in the interest of interoperability can be paved in 2 ways. First, a map to standard terminologies ensures that each data element\'s (variable\'s) definition is unambiguous and that it has a single, unique interpretation across studies. Second, the exchange of these data is assisted by "wrapping" them in a standard exchange format, such as Fast Health care Interoperability Resources or the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium\'s Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization Model.', 'CI': ['(c)Caroline Stellmach, Sina Marie Hopff, Thomas Jaenisch, Susana Marina Nunes de', 'Miranda, Eugenia Rinaldi, The NAPKON, LEOSS, ORCHESTRA, and ReCoDID Working', 'Groups.

MENDS-on-FHIR examined using Health Language Seven's Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7((R)) FHIR((R))) and US Core Implementation Guide (US Core IG) compliant resources derived from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to create a standards-based ETL pipeline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The input data source was a research data warehouse containing clinical and administrative data in OMOP CDM Version 5.3 format. OMOP-to-FHIR transformations, using a unique JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-to-JSON transformation language called Whistle, created FHIR R4 V4.0.1/US Core IG V4.0.0 conformant resources that were stored in a local FHIR server. A REST-based Bulk FHIR $export request extracted FHIR resources to populate a local MENDS database. RESULTS: Eleven OMOP tables were used to create 10 FHIR/US Core compliant resource types. A total of 1.13 trillion resources were extracted and inserted into the MENDS repository. A very low rate of non-compliant resources was observed. DISCUSSION: OMOP-to-FHIR transformation results passed validation with less than a 1% non-compliance rate. These standards-compliant FHIR resources provided standardized data elements required by the MENDS surveillance use case. The Bulk FHIR application programming interface (API) enabled population-level data exchange using interoperable FHIR resources. The OMOP-to-FHIR transformation pipeline creates a FHIR interface for accessing OMOP data.

To address this limitation, we evaluated the feasibility of extracting treatment data directly from EHRs using the REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) module for future submission to the INRGdc. METHODS: Patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group neuroblastoma biology study ANBL00B1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00904241) who received care at the University of Chicago (UChicago) or the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) after the go-live dates for the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-compliant EHRs were identified. Antineoplastic drug orders were extracted using the CDIS module. To validate the CDIS output, antineoplastic agents extracted through FHIR were compared with those queried through EHR relational databases (UChicago's Clinical Research Data Warehouse and VUMC's Epic Clarity database) and manual chart review. RESULTS: The analytic cohort consisted of 41 patients at UChicago and 32 VUMC patients. Antineoplastic drug orders were identified in the extracted EHR records of 39 (95.1%) UChicago patients and 26 (81.3%) VUMC patients. Manual chart review confirmed that patients with missing (n = 8) or discontinued (n = 1) orders in the CDIS output did not receive antineoplastic agents during the timeframe of the study. More than 99% of the antineoplastic drug orders in the EHR relational databases were identified in the corresponding CDIS output.

This article aims to share insights into the background of the recent national health data standardization policy, the activities of the Health Data Standardization Taskforce, and the future direction of health data standardization in Korea. METHODS: To ensure health data interoperability, the Health Data Standardization Taskforce was jointly organized by the public and private sectors in December 2022. The taskforce operated three working groups. It reviewed international trends in interoperability standardization, assessed the current status of health data standardization, discussed its vision, mission, and strategies, engaged in short-term standardization activities, and established a governance system for standardization. RESULTS: On September 15, 2023, the notice of "Health Data Terminology and Transmission Standards" in Korea was thoroughly revised to improve the exchange of health information between information systems and ensure interoperability. This notice includes the Korea Core Data for Interoperability (KR CDI) and the Korea Core Data Transmission Standard (HL7 FHIR KR Core), which are outcomes of the taskforce\'s efforts.

Important general conditions are data privacy and IT security for the use of health data in biomedical research. To this end, suitable methods are used in dedicated task forces to enable procedural, syntactic, and semantic interoperability for data use projects. The MII core dataset was developed as several modules with corresponding information models and implemented using the HL7(R) FHIR(R) standard to enable content-related and technical specifications for the interoperable provision of healthcare data through the DIC.

METHOD: We curated 3 phenotypes: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), excessive alcohol use, and incident influenza-like illness (ILI) using CQL to define clinical and administrative logic. We defined our phenotypes with valuesets, using SNOMED's hierarchy and expression constraint language, and CQL, combining valuesets and adding temporal elements where needed. We compared the count of cases found using PhEMA with our existing approach using convenience datasets. We assessed our new approach against published desiderata for phenotypes. RESULTS: The T2DM phenotype could be defined as 2 intensionally defined SNOMED valuesets and a CQL script. It increased the prevalence from 7.2% to 7.3%. Excess alcohol phenotype was defined by valuesets that added qualitative clinical terms to the quantitative conceptual definitions we currently use; this change increased prevalence by 58%, from 1.2% to 1.9%. We created an ILI valueset with SNOMED concepts, adding a temporal element using CQL to differentiate new episodes. This increased the weekly incidence in our convenience sample (weeks 26-38) from 0.95 cases to 1.11 cases per 100 000 people. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypes for surveillance and research can be described fully and comprehensibly using CQL and intensional FHIR valuesets. Our use case phenotypes identified a greater number of cases, whilst anticipated from excessive alcohol this was not for our other variable. This may have been due to our use of SNOMED CT hierarchy.

In this work, the common scenarios of capturing RTD in the healthcare from EHRs are studied and the approaches and tools to implement real-time solutions are investigated. METHODS: Delivering RTD by representational state transfer (REST) application programming interfaces (APIs) is usually accomplished through a Publish-Subscribe approach. Common technologies and protocols used for implementing subscriptions are REST hooks and WebSockets. Polling is a straightforward mechanism for obtaining updates; nevertheless, it may not be the most efficient or scalable solution. In such cases, other approaches are often preferred. Database triggers and reverse proxies can be useful in RTD scenarios; however, they should be designed carefully to avoid performance bottlenecks and potential issues. RESULTS: The implementation of subscriptions through REST hooks and WebSocket notifications using a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) REST API, as well as the design of a reverse proxy and database triggers is described. Reference implementations of the solutions are provided in a GitHub repository. For the reverse proxy implementation, the Go language (Golang) was used, which is specialized for the development of server-side networking applications. For FHIR servers a python script is provided to create a sample Subscription resource to send RTD when a new Observation resource for specific patient id is created. The sample WebSocket client is written using the "websocket-client" python library. The sample RTD endpoint is created using the "Flask" framework. For database triggers a sample structured query language (SQL) query for Postgres to create a trigger when an INSERT or UPDATE operation is executed on the FHIR resource table is available. Furthermore, a use case clinical example, where the main actors are the healthcare providers (hospitals, physician private practices, general practitioners and medical laboratories), health information networks and the patient are drawn. The RTD flow and exchange is shown in detail and how it could improve healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Capturing RTD is undoubtedly vital for health professionals and successful digital healthcare. The topic remains unexplored especially in the context of EHRs. In our work for the first time the common scenarios and problems are investigated. Furthermore, solutions and reference implementations are provided which could support and contribute to the development of real-time applications.', 'CI': ['2024 mHealth.

RESULTS: WebSocket showed much better transfer times of large amount of data. These were 18 s shorter in the local network and 342 s shorter in WAN for the 20 resource per Bundle transfer. CONCLUSION: RESTful APIs are a convenient way to implement EHR servers; on the other hand, HTTP becomes a bottleneck when transferring large amount of data.

The development is guided by modern, cloud-native design principles and based on Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) as an interoperability standard with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) being used as a source of patient data. We evaluated the usability using the system usability scale (SUS) after deploying the application for use by study personnel. RESULTS: The implementation is based on the OMOP CDM as a repository of patient data that is continuously queried for possible trial candidates based on given clinical trial eligibility criteria. A web-based screening list can be used to display the candidates and email notifications about possible new trial participants can be sent automatically. All interactions between services use HL7 FHIR as the communication standard. The system can be installed using standard container technology and supports more sophisticated deployments on Kubernetes clusters. End-users (n = 19) rated the system with a SUS score of 79.9/100.

METHODS:  Risk for severe in-hospital outcomes was estimated using a validated ordinal logistic regression model to classify pneumonia severity. To render the results usable for ED clinicians, we created an integrated SMART on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) web application built for interoperable use in two pediatric EDs using different EHR vendors: Epic and Cerner. We followed a UCD framework, including problem analysis and user research, conceptual design and early prototyping, user interface development, formative evaluation, and postdeployment summative evaluation. RESULTS:  Problem analysis and user research from 39 clinicians and nurses revealed user preferences for risk aversion, accessibility, and timing of risk communication. Early prototyping and iterative design incorporated evidence-based design principles, including numeracy, risk framing, and best-practice visualization techniques. After rigorous unit and end-to-end testing, the application was successfully deployed in both EDs, which facilitated enrollment, randomization, model visualization, data capture, and reporting for trial purposes. CONCLUSION:  The successful implementation of a custom application for pneumonia prognosis and clinical trial support in two health systems on different EHRs demonstrates the importance of UCD, adherence to modern clinical data standards, and rigorous testing. Key lessons included the need for understanding users' real-world needs, regular knowledge management, application maintenance, and the recognition that FHIR applications require careful configuration for interoperability.", 'CI': ['Thieme.

These medical devices provide exact measures and raw data such as imaging data or biosignals. So far, the Broad Integration of These Health Data into Hospital Information Technology Structures-Especially in Germany-is Lacking, and if data integration takes place, only non-Evaluable Findings are Usually Integrated into the Hospital Information Technology Structures. A Comprehensive Integration of raw Data and Structured Medical Information has not yet Been Established. The aim of this project was to design and implement an interoperable database (cardio-vascular-information-system, CVIS) for the automated integration of al medical device data (parameters and raw data) in cardio-vascular medicine. METHODS: The CVIS serves as a data integration and preparation system at the interface between the various devices and the hospital IT infrastructure. In our project, we were able to establish a database with integration of proprietary device interfaces, which could be integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) with various HL7 and web interfaces. RESULTS: In the period between 1.7.2020 and 30.6.2022, the data integrated into this database were evaluated. During this time, 114,858 patients were automatically included in the database and medical data of 50,295 of them were entered. For technical examinations, more than 4.5 million readings (an average of 28.5 per examination) and 684,696 image data and raw signals (28,935 ECG files, 655,761 structured reports, 91,113 x-ray objects, 559,648 ultrasound objects in 54 different examination types, 5,000 endoscopy objects) were integrated into the database. Over 10.2 million bidirectional HL7 messages (approximately 14,000/day) were successfully processed. 98,458 documents were transferred to the central document management system, 55,154 materials (average 7.77 per order) were recorded and stored in the database, 21,196 diagnoses and 50,353 services/OPS were recorded and transferred. On average, 3.3 examinations per patient were recorded; in addition, there are an average of 13 laboratory examinations. DISCUSSION: Fully automated data integration from medical devices including the raw data is feasible and already creates a comprehensive database for multimodal modern analysis approaches in a short time. This is the basis for national and international projects by extracting research data using FHIR.', 'CI': ['(c) 2024 Martens, Haase, Mastella, Henkel, Spinner, Hahn, Zou, Fava Sanches,', 'Allescher,

OBJECTIVES:  Our goal was to introduce a systematic approach to standardizing and digitizing pediatric consent forms, which are complex due to legal requirements for child and legal guardian involvement. METHODS:  First, we reviewed the consent requirements from the Arizona regulation, and we used 21 pediatric treatment consents from five Arizona health care organizations to propose and evaluate an implementation-agnostic Consent for Treatment Framework. Second, we assessed the adequacy of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to support the proposed framework. RESULTS:  The resulting Consent for Treatment Framework supports compliance with the state consent requirements and has been validated with pediatric consent forms. We also demonstrated that the FHIR standard has the required expressiveness to compute the framework's specifications and express the 21 consent forms. CONCLUSION:  Health care organizations can apply the shared open-source code and FHIR implementation guidelines to standardize the design of machine-interpretable pediatric treatment consent forms. The resulting FHIR-based executable models may support compliance with the law and support interoperability and data sharing.", 'CI': ['Thieme.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an open-source Bulk FHIR Testing Suite at 5 healthcare sites from April to September 2023, including 4 hospitals using electronic health records (EHRs) certified for interoperability, and 1 Health Information Exchange (HIE) using a custom, standards-compliant API build. We measured export speeds, data sizes, and completeness across 6 types of FHIR. RESULTS: Among the certified platforms, Oracle Cerner led in speed, managing 5-16 million resources at over 8000 resources/min. Three Epic sites exported a FHIR data subset, achieving 1-12 million resources at 1555-2500 resources/min. Notably, the HIE's custom API outperformed, generating over 141 million resources at 12 000 resources/min. DISCUSSION: The HIE's custom API showcased superior performance, endorsing the effectiveness of SMART/HL7 Bulk FHIR in enabling large-scale data exchange while underlining the need for optimization in existing EHR platforms. Agility and scalability are essential for diverse health, research, and public health use cases. CONCLUSION: To fully realize the interoperability goals of the 21st Century Cures Act, addressing the performance limitations of Bulk FHIR API is critical.

They comprise 2 subprojects: COVID-19 Data Exchange (CODEX) and Coordination on Mobile Pandemic Apps Best Practice and Solution Sharing (COMPASS). CODEX provides a centralized and secure data storage platform for research data, whereas in COMPASS, expert panels were gathered to develop a reference app framework for capturing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) that can be used by any researcher. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to integrate the data collected with the COMPASS reference app framework into the central CODEX platform, so that they can be used by secondary researchers. Although both projects used the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, it was not used in a way that data could be shared directly. Given the short time frame and the parallel developments within the CODEX platform, a pragmatic and robust solution for an interface component was required. METHODS: We have developed a means to facilitate and promote the use of the German Corona Consensus (GECCO) data set, a core data set for COVID-19 research in Germany. In this way, we ensured semantic interoperability for the app-collected PRO data with the COMPASS app. We also developed an interface component to sustain syntactic interoperability. RESULTS: The use of different FHIR types by the COMPASS reference app framework (the general-purpose FHIR Questionnaire) and the CODEX platform (eg, Patient, Condition, and Observation) was found to be the most significant obstacle. Therefore, we developed an interface component that realigns the Questionnaire items with the corresponding items in the GECCO data set and provides the correct resources for the CODEX platform. We extended the existing COMPASS questionnaire editor with an import function for GECCO items, which also tags them for the interface component. This ensures syntactic interoperability and eases the reuse of the GECCO data set for researchers. CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows how PRO data, which are collected across various studies conducted by different researchers, can be captured in a research-compatible way. This means that the data can be shared with a central research infrastructure and be reused by other researchers to gain more insights about COVID-19 and its sequelae.', 'CI': ['(c)Johannes Benedict Oehm, Sarah Luise Riepenhausen, Michael Storck, Martin Dugas,', 'Rudiger Pryss, Julian Varghese.

We describe a customizable, modular data retrieval application (RIL-workflow), which integrates clinical notes, images, and prescription data, and show its feasibility applied to research at our institution.

In clinical practice, federal regulations are now mandating the use of data messaging standards, i.e., the Health Level Seven (HL7((R))) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR((R))) standard, to facilitate the electronic exchange of clinical (patient) data. In both research and public health practice, we can also leverage FHIR((R)) ‒ and the infrastructure already in place for supporting exchange of clinical practice data ‒ to enable seamless exchange between the electronic medical record and public health registries. That said, in order to understand the current utility of FHIR((R)) for supporting the public health use case, we must first measure the extent to which the standard resources map to the required registry data elements. Thus, using a systematic mapping approach, we evaluated the level of completeness of the FHIR((R)) standard to support data collection for three public health registries (Trauma, Stroke, and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program). On average, approximately 80% of data elements were available in FHIR((R)) (71%, 77%, and 92%, respectively; inter-annotator agreement rates: 82%, 78%, and 72%, respectively). This tells us that there is the potential for significant automation to support EHR-to-Registry data exchange, which will reduce the amount of manual, error-prone processes and ensure higher data quality.

Standards are important not only for successfully exchanging data but also for appropriately interpreting them (semantic interoperability). Thus, to facilitate the semantic interoperability of data exchanged in health care, considerable resources have been deployed to improve the quality of shared clinical data by structuring and mapping them to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are 2-fold: to inventory the studies on FHIR semantic interoperability resources and terminologies and to identify and classify the approaches and contributions proposed in these studies. METHODS: A systematic mapping review (SMR) was conducted using 10 electronic databases as sources of information for inventory and review studies published during 2012 to 2022 on the development and improvement of semantic interoperability using the FHIR standard. RESULTS: A total of 70 FHIR studies were selected and analyzed to identify FHIR resource types and terminologies from a semantic perspective. The proposed semantic approaches were classified into 6 categories, namely mapping (31/126, 24.6%), terminology services (18/126, 14.3%), resource description framework or web ontology language-based proposals (24/126, 19%), annotation proposals (18/126, 14.3%), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) proposals (20/126, 15.9%), and ontology-based proposals (15/126, 11.9%). From 2012 to 2022, there has been continued research in 6 categories of approaches as well as in new and emerging annotations and ML and NLP proposals. This SMR also classifies the contributions of the selected studies into 5 categories: framework or architecture proposals, model proposals, technique proposals, comparison services, and tool proposals. The most frequent type of contribution is the proposal of a framework or architecture to enable semantic interoperability. CONCLUSIONS: This SMR provides a classification of the different solutions proposed to address semantic interoperability using FHIR at different levels: collecting, extracting and annotating data, modeling electronic health record data from legacy systems, and applying transformation and mapping to FHIR models and terminologies. The use of ML and NLP for unstructured data is promising and has been applied to specific use case scenarios. In addition, terminology services are needed to accelerate their use and adoption; furthermore, techniques and tools to automate annotation and ontology comparison should help reduce human interaction.', 'CI': ['(c)Fouzia Amar, Alain April, Alain Abran.

This requirement becomes more powerful if EHI exports use interoperable application programming interfaces (APIs). We sought to advance the ecosystem, instantiating policy desiderata in a working reference implementation based on a consensus design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We formulate a model for interoperable, patient-controlled, app-driven access to EHI exports in an open source reference implementation following the Argonaut FHIR Accelerator consensus implementation guide for EHI Export. RESULTS: The reference implementation, which asynchronously provides EHI across an API, has three central components: a web application for patients to request EHI exports, an EHI server to respond to requests, and an administrative export management web application to manage requests. It leverages mandated SMART on FHIR/Bulk FHIR APIs. DISCUSSION: A patient-controlled app enabling full EHI export from any EHR across an API could facilitate national-scale patient-directed information exchange. We hope releasing these tools sparks engagement from the health IT community to evolve the design, implement and test in real-world settings, and develop patient-facing apps. CONCLUSION: To advance regulatory innovation, we formulate a model that builds on existing requirements under the Cures Act Rule and takes a step toward an interoperable, scalable approach, simplifying patient access to their own health data; supporting the sharing of clinical data for both improved patient care and medical research; and encouraging the growth of an ecosystem of third-party applications.", 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2024.

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) is the standard that enables the design and development of interoperable systems with broad adoption worldwide. However, FHIR training curriculums need an easily administered web-based self-learning platform with modules to create scenarios and questions that the learner answers. This paper proposes a system for teaching FHIR that automatically evaluates the answers, providing the learner with continuous feedback and progress. OBJECTIVE: We are designing and developing a learning management system for creating, applying, deploying, and automatically assessing FHIR web-based courses. METHODS: The system requirements for teaching FHIR were collected through interviews with experts involved in academic and professional FHIR activities (universities and health institutions). The interviews were semistructured, recording and documenting each meeting. In addition, we used an ad hoc instrument to register and analyze all the needs to elicit the requirements. Finally, the information obtained was triangulated with the available evidence. This analysis was carried out with Atlas-ti software. For design purposes, the requirements were divided into functional and nonfunctional. The functional requirements were (1) a test and question manager, (2) an application programming interface (API) to orchestrate components, (3) a test evaluator that automatically evaluates the responses, and (4) a client application for students. Security and usability are essential nonfunctional requirements to design functional and secure interfaces. The software development methodology was based on the traditional spiral model. The end users of the proposed system are (1) the system administrator for all technical aspects of the server, (2) the teacher designing the courses, and (3) the students interested in learning FHIR. RESULTS: The main result described in this work is Huemul, a learning management system for training on FHIR, which includes the following components: (1) Huemul Admin: a web application to create users, tests, and questions and define scores; (2) Huemul API: module for communication between different software components (FHIR server, client, and engine); (3) Huemul Engine: component for answers evaluation to identify differences and validate the content; and (4) Huemul Client: the web application for users to show the test and questions. Huemul was successfully implemented with 416 students associated with the 10 active courses on the platform. In addition, the teachers have created 60 tests and 695 questions. Overall, the 416 students who completed their courses rated Huemul highly. CONCLUSIONS: Huemul is the first platform that allows the creation of courses, tests, and questions that enable the automatic evaluation and feedback of FHIR operations. Huemul has been implemented in multiple FHIR teaching scenarios for health care professionals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case study was conducted on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV Emergency Department (MIMIC-ED) dataset, a deidentified clinical dataset converted into FHIR. The FAIRness of this dataset was assessed using a set of common FAIR assessment indicators. RESULTS: The FHIR distribution of MIMIC-ED, comprising an implementation guide and demo data, was more FAIR compared to the non-FHIR distribution. The FAIRness score increased from 60 to 82 out of 95 points, a relative improvement of 37%. The most notable improvements were observed in interoperability, with a score increase from 5 to 19 out of 19 points, and reusability, with a score increase from 8 to 14 out of 24 points.

However, the infusion rate entered into the infusion pump by the health care provider cannot be automatically reconciled with the injection order information entered into the electronic medical records (EMRs). This is because of the difficulty in linking the infusion rate entered into the infusion pump by the health care provider with the injection order information entered into the EMRs. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated a data linkage method for reconciling infusion pump settings with injection orders in the EMRs. METHODS: We devised and implemented a mechanism to convert injection order information into the Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), a new health information exchange standard, and match it with an infusion pump management system in a standard and simple manner using a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). The injection order information was extracted from Standardized Structured Medical Record Information Exchange version 2 International Organization for Standardization/technical specification 24289:2021 and was converted to the FHIR format using a commercially supplied FHIR conversion module and our own mapping definition. Data were also sent to the infusion pump management system using the REST Web API. RESULTS: Information necessary for injection implementation in hospital wards can be transferred to FHIR and linked. The infusion pump management system application screen allowed the confirmation that the two pieces of information matched, and it displayed an error message if they did not. CONCLUSION: Using FHIR, the data linkage between EMRs and infusion pump management systems can be smoothly implemented. We plan to develop a new mechanism that contributes to medical safety through the actual implementation and verification of this matching system.', 'CI': ['Thieme.

To achieve this, it is essential for health data platforms to incorporate standards that facilitate addressing needs such as formal modeling of clinical knowledge (health domain concepts) as well as the harmonized persistence, query, and exchange of data across different information systems and organizations. However, the selection of these specifications has not been consistent across the different health data initiatives, often applying standards to address needs for which they were not originally designed. This issue is essential in the current scenario of implementing the European Health Data Space, which advocates harmonization, interoperability, and reuse of data without regulating the specific standards to be applied for this purpose. Therefore, this viewpoint aims to establish a coherent, agnostic, and homogeneous framework for the use of the most impactful EHR standards in the new-generation health data spaces: OpenEHR, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13606, and Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Thus, a panel of EHR standards experts has discussed several critical points to reach a consensus that will serve decision-making teams in health data platform projects who may not be experts in these EHR standards. It was concluded that these specifications possess different capabilities related to modeling, flexibility, and implementation resources.

With the advent of data-driven healthcare, Internet of medical things, wearable technologies, and machine learning, we expect this to accelerate and to be used in new and promising ways, including early warning systems and precision diagnostics. Hence, we see an ever-increasing need for retrieving, storing, and managing the large amount of biomedical signal data generated. The popularity of standards, such as HL7 FHIR for interoperability and data transfer, have also resulted in their use as a data storage model, which is inefficient. This article raises concern about the inefficiency of using FHIR for storage of biomedical signals and instead highlights the possibility of a sustainable storage based on data compression. Most reported efforts have focused on ECG signals; however, many other typical biomedical signals are understudied. In this article, we are considering arterial blood pressure, photoplethysmography, and respiration. We focus on simple lossless compression with low implementation complexity, low compression delay, and good compression ratios suitable for wide adoption.

MENDS-on-FHIR examined using Health Language Seven's Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7((R)) FHIR((R))) and US Core Implementation Guide (US Core IG) compliant resources derived from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to create a standards-based ETL pipeline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The input data source was a research data warehouse containing clinical and administrative data in OMOP CDM Version 5.3 format. OMOP-to-FHIR transformations, using a unique JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-to-JSON transformation language called Whistle, created FHIR R4 V4.0.1/US Core IG V4.0.0 conformant resources that were stored in a local FHIR server. A REST-based Bulk FHIR $export request extracted FHIR resources to populate a local MENDS database. RESULTS: Eleven OMOP tables were used to create 10 FHIR/US Core compliant resource types. A total of 1.13 trillion resources were extracted and inserted into the MENDS repository. A very low rate of non-compliant resources was observed. DISCUSSION: OMOP-to-FHIR transformation results passed validation with less than a 1% non-compliance rate. These standards-compliant FHIR resources provided standardized data elements required by the MENDS surveillance use case. The Bulk FHIR application programming interface (API) enabled population-level data exchange using interoperable FHIR resources. The OMOP-to-FHIR transformation pipeline creates a FHIR interface for accessing OMOP data. CONCLUSION: MENDS-on-FHIR successfully replaced custom ETL with standards-based interoperable FHIR resources using Bulk FHIR.

In this context, this study delineates a pan-European hackathon aimed at evaluating the efforts undertaken by member states of the European Union to develop a European electronic health record exchange format. This format is intended to facilitate secure cross-border healthcare and optimize service delivery to citizens, paving the way toward a unified European health data space. METHODS: The hackathon was conducted within the scope of the X-eHealth project. Interested parties were initially presented with a representative clinical scenario and a set of specifications pertaining to the European electronic health record exchange format, encompassing Laboratory Results Reports, Medical Imaging and Reports, and Hospital Discharge Reports. In addition, five onboarding webinars and two professional training events were organized to support the participating entities. To ensure a minimum acceptable quality threshold, a set of inclusion criteria for participants was outlined for the interested teams. RESULTS: Eight teams participated in the hackathon, showcasing state-of-the-art applications. These teams utilized technologies such as Health Level Seven-Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) and Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), alongside pertinent IHE integration profiles. They demonstrated a range of complementary uses and practices, contributing substantial inputs toward the development of future-proof electronic health record management systems. CONCLUSIONS: The execution of the hackathon demonstrated the efficacy of such approaches in uniting teams from diverse backgrounds to develop state-of-the-art applications.

METHODS: Stakeholders including childhood cancer survivors (CCSs), healthcare providers (HCPs), managers, information and technology (IT) specialists, and others, participated in six online Open Space meetings. Topics related to Care, Ethical, Legal, Social, Economic, and Information & IT-related aspects of implementing SurPass were evaluated. RESULTS: The study identified 115 barriers and 159 facilitators. The main barriers included the lack of standardised LTFU care in centres and network cooperation, uncertainty about SurPass accessibility, and uncertainty about how to integrate SurPass into electronic health information systems. The main facilitators included standardised and coordinated LTFU care in centres, allowing CCSs to conceal sensitive information in SurPass and (semi)automatic data transfer and filing. CONCLUSIONS: Key barriers to SurPass implementation were identified in the areas of care, ethical considerations, and information & IT. To address these barriers and facilitate the implementation on SurPass, we have formulated 27 recommendations. Key recommendations include using the internationally developed protocols and guidelines to implement LTFU care, making clear decisions about which parties have access to SurPass data in accordance with CCSs, and facilitating (semi)automated data transfer and filing using Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR).

Adverse drug events (ADE) are among the main threats to patient safety. Children are at a higher risk of ADE in each stage of medication management process. ADE rate is high in the administration stage, as the final stage of preventing medication errors in pediatrics and neonates. The most effective way to reduce ADE rate is using medication administration clinical decision support systems (MACDSSs). The present study reviewed the literature on MACDSS for neonates and pediatrics. It identified and classified the data elements that mapped onto the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard and the functionalities of these systems to guide future research. METHODS: PubMed/ MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and ProQuest databases were searched from 1995 to June 31, 2021. Studies that addressed developing or applying medication administration software for neonates and pediatrics were included. Two authors reviewed the titles, abstracts, and full texts. The quality of eligible studies was assessed based on the level of evidence. The extracted data elements were mapped onto the FHIR standard. RESULTS: In the initial search, 4,856 papers were identified. After removing duplicates, 3,761 titles, and abstracts were screened. Finally, 56 full-text papers remained for evaluation. The full-text review of papers led to the retention of 10 papers which met the eligibility criteria. In addition, two papers from the reference lists were included. A total number of 12 papers were included for analysis. Six papers were categorized as high-level evidence. Only three papers evaluated their systems in a real environment. A variety of data elements and functionalities could be observed. Overall, 84 unique data elements were extracted from the included papers. The analysis of reported functionalities showed that 18 functionalities were implemented in these systems. CONCLUSION: Identifying the data elements and functionalities as a roadmap by developers can significantly improve MACDSS performance. Though many CDSSs have been developed for different medication processes in neonates and pediatrics, few have actually evaluated MACDSSs in reality. Therefore, further research is needed on the application and evaluation of MACDSSs in the real environment. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bwbwpape).', 'CI': ['(c) 2023.

CDS can be designed to save health care providers time and help them provide safe and personalized analgesic prescribing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this report is to describe the development of a CDS system designed to provide dentists with personalized pain management recommendations to reduce opioid prescribing following extractions. The use of CDS is also examined. METHODS: This study was conducted in HealthPartners, which uses an electronic health record (EHR) system that integrates both medical and dental information upon which the CDS application was developed based on SMART (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies) on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). The various tools used to bring relevant medical conditions, medications, patient history, and other relevant data into the CDS interface are described. The CDS application runs a drug interaction algorithm developed by our organization and provides patient-specific recommendations. The CDS included access to the state Prescription Monitoring Program database. IMPLEMENTATION (RESULTS): The pain management CDS was implemented as part of a study examining opioid prescribing among patients undergoing dental extraction procedures from February 17, 2020, to May 14, 2021. Provider-level use of CDS at extraction encounters ranged from 0% to 87.4% with 12.1% of providers opening the CDS for no encounters, 39.4% opening the CDS for 1%-20% of encounters, 36.4% opening it for 21%-50% of encounters, and 12.1% opening it for 51%-87% of encounters. CONCLUSIONS: The pain management CDS is an EHR-embedded, provider-facing tool to help dentists make personalized pain management recommendations following dental extractions. The SMART on FHIR-based pain management CDS adapted well to the point-of-care dental setting and led to the design of a scalable CDS tool that is EHR vendor agnostic.

RCTs include highly selected patient populations that fit specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although they may have a lower level of certainty than RCTs on the evidence hierarchy, real-world data (RWD), such as observational studies, registries and databases, provide real-world evidence (RWE) that can complement RCTs. For example, RWE may help satisfy requirements for a new indication of an already approved drug and help us better understand long-term treatment effectiveness, safety and patterns of use in clinical practice. Many countries have set up registries, observational studies and databases containing information on patients with retinal diseases, such as diabetic macular oedema (DMO). These DMO RWD have produced significant clinical evidence in the past decade that has changed the management of DMO. RWD and medico-administrative databases are a useful resource to identify low frequency safety signals. They often have long-term follow-up with a large number of patients and minimal exclusion criteria. We will discuss improvements in healthcare information exchange technologies, such as blockchain technology and FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), which will connect and extend databases already available.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an open-source Bulk FHIR Testing Suite at five healthcare sites from April to September 2023, including four hospitals using EHRs certified for interoperability, and one Health Information Exchange (HIE) using a custom, standards-compliant API build. We measured export speeds, data sizes, and completeness across six types of FHIR resources. RESULTS: Among the certified platforms, Oracle Cerner led in speed, managing 5-16 million resources at over 8,000 resources/min. Three Epic sites exported a FHIR data subset, achieving 1-12 million resources at 1,555-2,500 resources/min. Notably, the HIE's custom API outperformed, generating over 141 million resources at 12,000 resources/min. DISCUSSION: The HIE's custom API showcased superior performance, endorsing the effectiveness of SMART/HL7 Bulk FHIR in enabling large-scale data exchange while underlining the need for optimization in existing EHR platforms. Agility and scalability are essential for diverse health, research, and public health use cases.

But with the rapid evolution of genomics knowledge, reported annotations can quickly become out-of-date. Under the ONC Sync for Genes program, our team sought to standardize the sharing of dynamically annotated variants (e.g., variants annotated on demand, based on current knowledge). The computable biomedical knowledge artifacts that were developed enable a clinical decision support (CDS) application to surface up-to-date annotations to clinicians. METHODS: The work reported in this article relies on the Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Genomics and Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Variant Annotation (VA) standards. We developed a CDS pipeline that dynamically annotates patient's variants through an intersection with current knowledge and serves up the FHIR-encoded variants and annotations (diagnostic and therapeutic implications, molecular consequences, population allele frequencies) via FHIR Genomics Operations. ClinVar, CIViC, and PharmGKB were used as knowledge sources, encoded as per the GA4GH VA specification. RESULTS: Primary public artifacts from this project include a GitHub repository with all source code, a Swagger interface that allows anyone to visualize and interact with the code using only a web browser, and a backend database where all (synthetic and anonymized) patient data and knowledge are housed. CONCLUSIONS: We found that variant annotation varies in complexity based on the variant type, and that various bioinformatics strategies can greatly improve automated annotation fidelity. More importantly, we demonstrated the feasibility of an ecosystem where genomic knowledge bases have standardized knowledge (e.g., based on the GA4GH VA spec), and CDS applications can dynamically leverage that knowledge to provide real-time decision support, based on current knowledge, to clinicians at the point of care.", 'CI': ['(c) 2023 The Authors.

However, the reuse of cases and their sharing with other platforms is a problem, as it encapsulates knowledge in isolated platforms without interoperability. This paper proposed a workflow ecosystem for the collaborative design and distribution of clinical cases through web-based computing platforms that (1) allow medical students to create clinical cases collaboratively in a dedicated environment; (2) make it possible to export these clinical cases in terms of the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) interoperability standard; (3) provide support to transform imported cases into learning object repositories; and (4) use e-learning standards (eg, Instructional Management Systems Content Packaging [IMS-CP] or Sharable Content Object Reference Model [SCORM]) to incorporate this content into widely-used learning management systems (LMSs), letting medical students democratize a valuable knowledge that would otherwise be confined within proprietary platforms. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a workflow ecosystem based on IT platforms to enable the collaborative creation, export, and deployment of clinical cases. METHODS: The ecosystem infrastructure for computer-supported collaborative design of standardized clinical cases consists of three platforms: (1) Mosaico, a platform used in the design of clinical cases; (2) Clavy, a tool for the flexible management of learning object repositories, which is used to orchestrate the transformation and processing of these clinical cases; and (3) Moodle, an LMS that is geared toward publishing the processed clinical cases and delivering their course deployment stages in IMS-CP or SCORM format. The generation of cases in Mosaico is exported in the HL7 FHIR interoperability standard to Clavy, which is then responsible for creating and deploying a learning object in Moodle. RESULTS: The main result was an interoperable ecosystem that demonstrates the feasibility of automating the stages of collaborative clinical case creation, export through HL7 FHIR standards, and deployment in an LMS. This ecosystem enables the generation of IMS-CPs associated with the original Mosaico clinical cases that can be deployed in conventional third-party LMSs, thus allowing the democratization and sharing of clinical cases to different platforms in standard and interoperable formats. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we proposed, implemented, and demonstrated the feasibility of developing a standards-based workflow that interoperates multiple platforms with heterogeneous technologies to create, transform, and deploy clinical cases on the web. This achieves the objective of transforming the created cases into a platform for web-based deployment in an LMS.', 'CI': ['(c) Sergio Guinez-Molinos, Felix Buendia-Garcia, Jose-Luis Sierra-Rodriguez,', 'Joaquin Gayoso-Cabada, Jaime Gonzalez-Diaz.

Subsequently, we implemented a patient summary web application concerning the IPS and evaluated 12 common use cases of the discharge summary. RESULTS: The FHIR resources of seven of the necessary IPS sections were successfully converted from existing SS-MIX2 data. In the main view of the application we developed, all the minimum necessary patient information was summarized and visualized. All types of mandatory or required sections in the IPS and all structured information items of the discharge summary were displayed. Of the discharge summary, 75% of sections and 61.7% of information items were completely displayed, matching 12 common use cases in Japan.

Key app features are FHIR-enabled access to structured data from the child's medical record, families' abilities to longitudinally track patient- or family-centered care goals, and sharing progress toward care goals with the child's primary care provider via a clinician dashboard. We shall enroll 40 parents or caregivers of children and youth with special health care needs to use the app for 6 months. Inclusion criteria for children and youth with special health care needs are age 0-16 years; primary care at a participating site; complex needs benefiting from CC; high hospitalization risk in the next 6 months; English speaking; having requisite technology at home (internet access, Apple iOS mobile device); and an active web-based EHR patient portal account to which a parent or caregiver has full proxy access. Digital prescriptions will be used to disseminate study recruitment materials directly to eligible participants via their existing EHR patient portal accounts. We will apply an intervention mixed methods design to link quantitative and qualitative (semistructured interviews and family engagement panels with parents of children and youth with special health care needs) data and characterize implementation determinants. Two CC frameworks (Pediatric Care Coordination Framework; Patient-Centered Medical Home) and 2 evaluation frameworks (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research; Technology Acceptance Model) provide theoretical foundations for this study. RESULTS: Participant recruitment began in fall 2022, before which we identified >300 potentially eligible patients in EHR data. A family engagement panel in fall 2021 generated formative feedback from family partners. Integrated analysis of pretrial quantitative and qualitative data informed family-centered enhancements to study procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will inform how to integrate an FHIR-enabled digital PHR app for children and youth with special health care needs into clinical care. Mixed methods and implementation research will help strengthen implementation in diverse clinical settings. The study is positioned to advance knowledge of how to use digital health innovations for improving care and outcomes for children and youth with special health care needs and their families.

There are several methods to prevent prescription errors, one of which is to use a Computerized Physician Order Entry system (CPOE). In a CPOE system, necessary data needs to be collected so that making decisions about prescribing medications and treatment plans could be made. Although many CPOE systems have been developed worldwide, studies have yet to identify the necessary data and data elements of CPOE systems. This study aims to identify data elements of CPOE and standardize these data with Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to facilitate data sharing and integration with the electronic health record (EHR) system and reduce data diversity. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus databases for studies up to October 2019 were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed original articles to determine eligibility for inclusion in this review. All articles describing data elements of a COPE system were included. Data elements were obtained from the included articles' text, tables, and figures.Classification of the extracted data elements and mapping them to FHIR was done to facilitate data sharing and integration with the electronic health record (EHR) system and reduce data diversity. The final data elements of CPOE were categorized into five main categories of FHIR (foundation, base, clinical, financial, and specialized) and 146 resources, where possible. One of the researchers did mapping and checked and verified by the second researcher. If a data element could not be mapped to any FHIR resources, this data element was considered an extension to the most relevant resource. RESULTS: We retrieved 5162 articles through database searches. After the full-text assessment, 21 articles were included. In total, 270 data elements were identified and mapped to the FHIR standard. These elements have been reported in 26 FHIR resources of 146 ones (18%). In total, 71 data elements were considered an extension. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that the same data elements were not used in the CPOE systems, and the degree of homogeneity of these systems is limited. The mapping of extracted data with data elements used in the FHIR standard shows the extent to which these systems comply with existing standards. Considering the standards in these systems' design helps developers design more coherent systems that can share data with other systems.", 'FAU': ['Montazeri, Mahdieh', 'Khajouei, Reza', 'Afraz, Ali', 'Ahmadian, Leila'], 'AU': ['Montazeri M', 'Khajouei R', 'Afraz A', 'Ahmadian L'], 'AD': ['Medical Informatics Research Center, Institute for Futures Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Health Information Sciences, Faculty of Management and Medical Information Sciences, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Health Information Sciences, Faculty of Management and Medical Information Sciences, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Medical Informatics Research Center, Institute for Futures Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Medical Informatics Research Center, Institute for Futures Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review'], 'DEP': '20231206', 'PL': 'England', 'TA': 'Inform Health Soc Care', 'JT': 'Informatics for health & social care', 'JID': '101475011', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Humans', '*Medical Order Entry Systems', 'Medication Errors/prevention & control', 'Software', 'Electronic Health Records'], 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['CPOE', 'FHIR', 'computerized physician order entry', 'data element'], 'EDAT': '2023/09/19 06:42', 'MHDA': '2023/12/07 12:42', 'CRDT': ['2023/09/19 02:31'], 'PHST': ['2023/12/07 12:42 [medline]', '2023/09/19 06:42 [pubmed]', '2023/09/19 02:31 [entrez]'], 'AID': ['10.1080/17538157.2023.2255285 [doi]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Inform Health Soc Care. 2023 Oct 2;48(4):402-419. doi: 10.1080/17538157.2023.2255285.

As a result, labs often must send non-structured PDF reports to the EHR. On the other hand, while FHIR adoption is growing, most EHRs support HL7 interoperability standards, particularly those based on the HL7 Version 2 (HL7v2) standard. The HL7 Version 2 genomics component of the HL7 Laboratory Results Interface (HL7v2 LRI) standard specifies a formalism for the structured communication of genomic data from lab to EHR. We previously described an open-source tool (vcf2fhir) that converts VCF files into HL7 FHIR format. In this report, we describe how the utility has been extended to output HL7v2 LRI data that contains both variants and variant annotations (e.g., predicted phenotypes and therapeutic implications). Using this HL7v2 converter, we implemented an automated pipeline for moving structured genomic data from the clinical laboratory to EHR. We developed an open source hl7v2GenomicsExtractor that converts genomic interpretation report files into a series of HL7v2 observations conformant to HL7v2 LRI. We further enhanced the converter to produce output conformant to Epic's genomic import specification and to support alternative input formats. An automated pipeline for pushing standards-based structured genomic data directly into the EHR was successfully implemented, where genetic variant data and the clinical annotations are now both available to be viewed in the EHR through Epic's genomics module. Issues encountered in the development and deployment of the HL7v2 converter primarily revolved around data variability issues, primarily lack of a standardized representation of data elements within various genomic interpretation report files. The technical implementation of a HL7v2 message transformation to feed genomic variant and clinical annotation data into an EHR has been successful. In addition to genetic variant data, the implementation described here releases the valuable asset of clinically relevant genomic annotations provided by labs from static PDFs to calculable, structured data in EHR systems.", 'CI': ['(c) 2023 The Authors.'], 'FAU': ['Dolin, Robert H', 'Gupta, Rohan', 'Newsom, Kimberly', 'Heale, Bret S E', 'Gothi, Shailesh', 'Starostik, Petr', 'Chamala, Srikar'], 'AU': ['Dolin RH', 'Gupta R', 'Newsom K', 'Heale BSE', 'Gothi S', 'Starostik P', 'Chamala S'], 'AD': ['Elimu Informatics, Inc, Richmond, CA, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Elimu Informatics, Inc, Richmond, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Humanized Health Consulting LLC, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, CA, USA.", 'Department of Pathology, University of Southern California, CA, USA.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230815', 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'J Pathol Inform', 'JT': 'Journal of pathology informatics', 'JID': '101528849', 'PMC': 'PMC10504540', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Clinical genomics', 'EHR', 'Electronic health record', 'Genomics module', 'HL7', 'Laboratory informatics'], 'COIS': ['The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the', 'research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.'], 'EDAT': '2023/09/18 06:41', 'MHDA': '2023/09/18 06:42', 'PMCR': ['2023/08/15'], 'CRDT': ['2023/09/18 04:17'], 'PHST': ['2023/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2023/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2023/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/09/18 06:42 [medline]', '2023/09/18 06:41 [pubmed]', '2023/09/18 04:17 [entrez]', '2023/08/15 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['S2153-3539(23)00144-X [pii]', '100330 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpi.2023.100330 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'J Pathol Inform. 2023 Aug 15;14:100330. doi: 10.1016/j.jpi.2023.100330. eCollection 2023.'}

Critical Incident Reporting Systems (CIRS) aim to minimize this by learning from errors and identifying potential risks. However, a lack of interoperability among the 16 CIRS in Germany hampers their effectiveness. METHODS: This study investigates reports' syntactic and semantic interoperability across seven different reporting systems. Syntactic interoperability was examined using WHO's Minimal Information Models (MIM), while semantic interoperability was evaluated with SNOMED concepts. RESULTS: The findings reveal a low structural overlap, with only two terms correctly represented in the SNOMED CT terminology. In addition, most systems showed no syntactic interoperability. CONCLUSION: Improving interoperability is essential for increasing the effectiveness and usability of CIRS. The study suggests a unified data model such as MIM or using Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) resources and expanding SNOMED CT with patient safety-relevant terms for semantic interoperability.

The CDA R2 standard, defined in 2005, is used for cross-institution retrieval of electronic medical records (Ministry of Health and Welfare, Information Department, 2021). However, CDA R2 only supports the exchange of clinical documents and is limited to the XML format. Due to the lack of a standardized framework for medical data exchange in Taiwan, different standards and specifications result in different data interface methods between systems, requiring customization for each system by healthcare institutions or the government. The inconsistency in data formats requires healthcare institutions and the government to spend more time on data parsing and mapping, resulting in slow integration of medical data. In this study, we simulated healthcare institutions using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for medical information exchange and utilized the exchanged medical information to create a dynamic dashboard to assist healthcare professionals in making medical decisions. To ensure information security, we employed Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) for secure transmission, which encrypts the transmitted medical record data using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, preventing deliberate interception and tampering of medical record data between the two systems.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates and compares the functionalities, strengths, and weaknesses of existing systems and proposes guidelines for optimizing future work with ML-CISs. METHODS: Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for articles describing machine learning systems that were used for clinical data analytics or decision support in compliance with FHIR standards. Information regarding each system's functionality, data sources, formats, security, performance, resource requirements, scalability, strengths, and limitations was compared across systems. RESULTS: A total of 39 articles describing FHIR-based ML-CISs were divided into the following three categories according to their primary focus: clinical decision support systems (n=18), data management and analytic platforms (n=10), or auxiliary modules and application programming interfaces (n=11). Model strengths included novel use of cloud systems, Bayesian networks, visualization strategies, and techniques for translating unstructured or free-text data to FHIR frameworks. Many intelligent systems lacked electronic health record interoperability and externally validated evidence of clinical efficacy.

Currently, OMOP CDM is populated with German Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) using an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process, which was designed as a bulk load. However, the computational effort that comes with an everyday full load is not efficient for daily recruitment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to extend our existing ETL process with the option of incremental loading to efficiently support daily updated data. METHODS: Based on our existing bulk ETL process, we performed an analysis to determine the requirements of incremental loading. Furthermore, a literature review was conducted to identify adaptable approaches. Based on this, we implemented three methods to integrate incremental loading into our ETL process. Lastly, a test suite was defined to evaluate the incremental loading for data correctness and performance compared to bulk loading. RESULTS: The resulting ETL process supports bulk and incremental loading. Performance tests show that the incremental load took 87.5% less execution time than the bulk load (2.12 min compared to 17.07 min) related to changes of 1 day, while no data differences occurred in OMOP CDM. CONCLUSIONS: Since incremental loading is more efficient than a daily bulk load and both loading options result in the same amount of data, we recommend using bulk load for an initial load and switching to incremental load for daily updates. The resulting incremental ETL logic can be applied internationally since it is not restricted to German FHIR profiles.', 'CI': ['(c) Elisa Henke, Yuan Peng, Ines Reinecke, Michele Zoch, Martin Sedlmayr, Franziska', 'Bathelt.

FHIR is presently in use largely to facilitate interactions between patient-facing healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, doctor's offices, and laboratories, for electronic health record management and exchange. There are several ongoing efforts to adapt the FHIR standard for regulatory use cases to support the needs of the global biopharmaceutical industry, including the exchange of Electronic Product Information (ePI); chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) data; and adverse event reporting. Once in place, this new method of data exchange is expected to (1) improve efficiency by reducing the time and effort needed to manage regulatory information; (2) accelerate decision making; (3) encourage innovation in pharmaceutical manufacturing; (4) improve the ability and agility of information exchange. Currently, the end-to-end timescale for the pharmaceutical regulatory workflow is measured in months and years. This new paradigm will use FHIR APIs and other supporting technologies to reduce the potential time for data exchange from months to days, hours, minutes, and eventually sub-seconds. With such drastic improvements in speed provided by digitization, automation, and interoperability, the biopharmaceutical industry can reach more patients, and more quickly than at any time in the industry's 100+ year history. The present work will focus on examining specific real-world implementation examples for using FHIR to support exchange of CMC information within and across the biopharmaceutical industry.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2023 The Authors.

This trend has accelerated the urgency to implement effective and efficient data exchange and service interoperability, which underpins coordinated care services among tiered health care institutions, improves the quality of oversight of regulators, and provides vast and comprehensive data collection to support clinical medicine and health economics research, thus improving the overall service quality and patient satisfaction. To meet this demand and facilitate the interoperability of IT systems of stakeholders, after years of preparation, Health Level 7 formally introduced, in 2014, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. It has since continued to evolve. FHIR depends on the Implementation Guide (IG) to ensure feasibility and consistency while developing an interoperable health care service. The IG defines rules with associated documentation on how FHIR resources are used to tackle a particular problem. However, a gap remains between IGs and the process of building actual services because IGs are rules without specifying concrete methods, procedures, or tools. Thus, stakeholders may feel it nontrivial to participate in the ecosystem, giving rise to the need for a more actionable practice guideline (PG) for promoting FHIR's fast adoption. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to propose a general FHIR PG to facilitate stakeholders in the health care ecosystem to understand FHIR and quickly develop interoperable health care services. METHODS: We selected a collection of FHIR-related papers about the latest studies or use cases on designing and building FHIR-based interoperable health care services and tagged each use case as belonging to 1 of the 3 dominant innovation feature groups that are also associated with practice stages, that is, data standardization, data management, and data integration. Next, we reviewed each group's detailed process and key techniques to build respective care services and collate a complete FHIR PG. Finally, as an example, we arbitrarily selected a use case outside the scope of the reviewed papers and mapped it back to the FHIR PG to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the PG. RESULTS: The FHIR PG includes 2 core elements: one is a practice design that defines the responsibilities of stakeholders and outlines the complete procedure from data to services, and the other is a development architecture for practice design, which lists the available tools for each practice step and provides direct and actionable recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The FHIR PG can bridge the gap between IGs and the process of building actual services by proposing actionable methods, procedures, and tools. It assists stakeholders in identifying participants' roles, managing the scope of responsibilities, and developing relevant modules, thus helping promote FHIR-based interoperable health care services.", 'CI': ['(c)Jingwen Nan, Li-Qun Xu.

To enable these efforts, researchers must agree on data set definitions that not only cover all elements relevant to the respective medical specialty but also are syntactically and semantically interoperable. Therefore, the German Corona Consensus (GECCO) data set was developed as a harmonized, interoperable collection of the most relevant data elements for COVID-19-related patient research. As the GECCO data set is a compact core data set comprising data across all medical fields, the focused research within particular medical domains demands the definition of extension modules that include data elements that are the most relevant to the research performed in those individual medical specialties. Objective: We aimed to (1) specify a workflow for the development of interoperable data set definitions that involves close collaboration between medical experts and information scientists and (2) apply the workflow to develop data set definitions that include data elements that are the most relevant to COVID-19-related patient research regarding immunization, pediatrics, and cardiology. Methods: We developed a workflow to create data set definitions that were (1) content-wise as relevant as possible to a specific field of study and (2) universally usable across computer systems, institutions, and countries (ie, interoperable). We then gathered medical experts from 3 specialties-infectious diseases (with a focus on immunization), pediatrics, and cardiology-to select data elements that were the most relevant to COVID-19-related patient research in the respective specialty. We mapped the data elements to international standardized vocabularies and created data exchange specifications, using Health Level Seven International (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). All steps were performed in close interdisciplinary collaboration with medical domain experts and medical information specialists. Profiles and vocabulary mappings were syntactically and semantically validated in a 2-stage process. Results: We created GECCO extension modules for the immunization, pediatrics, and cardiology domains according to pandemic-related requests. The data elements included in each module were selected, according to the developed consensus-based workflow, by medical experts from these specialties to ensure that the contents aligned with their research needs. We defined data set specifications for 48 immunization, 150 pediatrics, and 52 cardiology data elements that complement the GECCO core data set. We created and published implementation guides, example implementations, and data set annotations for each extension module. Conclusions: The GECCO extension modules, which contain data elements that are the most relevant to COVID-19-related patient research on infectious diseases (with a focus on immunization), pediatrics, and cardiology, were defined in an interdisciplinary, iterative, consensus-based workflow that may serve as a blueprint for developing further data set definitions.

No predictive model has been validated for critically ill children with acute neurological injury. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that PICU patients with concern for acute neurological injury are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality, and advanced analytics would derive robust, explainable subgroup models. METHODS: We performed a secondary subgroup analysis of the Trichotomous Outcomes in Pediatric Critical Care (TOPICC) study (2011-2013), predicting mortality and morbidity from admission physiology (lab values and vital signs in 6 h surrounding admission). We analyzed patients with suspected acute neurological injury using standard machine learning algorithms. Feature importance was analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). We created a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application to demonstrate potential for interoperability using pragmatic data. RESULTS: 1,860 patients had suspected acute neurological injury at PICU admission, with higher morbidity (8.2 vs. 3.4%) and mortality (6.2 vs. 1.9%) than those without similar concern. The ensemble regressor (containing Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine learners) produced the best model, with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.91 [95% CI (0.88, 0.94)] and Average Precision (AP) of 0.59 [0.51, 0.69] for mortality, and decreased performance predicting simultaneous mortality and morbidity (0.83 [0.80, 0.86] and 0.59 [0.51, 0.64]); at a set specificity of 0.995, positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.79 for mortality, and 0.88 for mortality and morbidity. By comparison, for mortality, the TOPICC logistic regression had AUROC of 0.90 [0.84, 0.93], but substantially inferior AP of 0.49 [0.35, 0.56] and PPV of 0.60 at specificity 0.995. Feature importance analysis showed that pupillary non-reactivity, Glasgow Coma Scale, and temperature were the most contributory vital signs, and acidosis and coagulopathy the most important laboratory values. The FHIR application provided a simulated demonstration of real-time health record query and model deployment. CONCLUSIONS: PICU patients with suspected acute neurological injury have higher mortality and morbidity. Our machine learning approach independently identified previously-known causes of secondary brain injury. Advanced modeling achieves improved positive predictive value in this important population compared to published models, providing a stepping stone in the path to deploying explainable models as interoperable bedside decision-support tools.', 'CI': ['(c) 2023 Munjal, Clark, Simon, Kochanek and Horvat.'], 'FAU': ['Munjal, Neil K', 'Clark, Robert S B', 'Simon, Dennis W', 'Kochanek, Patrick M', 'Horvat, Christopher M'], 'AU': ['Munjal NK', 'Clark RSB', 'Simon DW', 'Kochanek PM', 'Horvat CM'], 'AD': ['Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, United States.', "Department of Critical Care Medicine, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.", "Department of Critical Care Medicine, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.", "Department of Critical Care Medicine, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.", 'Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.', "Department of Critical Care Medicine, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States."], 'LA': ['eng'], 'GR': ['K23 HD099331/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD040686/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230628', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Front Pediatr', 'JT': 'Frontiers in pediatrics', 'JID': '101615492', 'PMC': 'PMC10338865', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['acute neurological injury', 'clinical decision support', 'machine learning', 'pediatric intensive care unit', 'predictive modeling'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2023/07/17 06:42', 'MHDA': '2023/07/17 06:43', 'PMCR': ['2023/06/28'], 'CRDT': ['2023/07/17 04:25'], 'PHST': ['2023/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2023/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/07/17 06:43 [medline]', '2023/07/17 06:42 [pubmed]', '2023/07/17 04:25 [entrez]', '2023/06/28 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['10.3389/fped.2023.1177470 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Front Pediatr. 2023 Jun 28;11:1177470. doi: 10.3389/fped.2023.1177470. eCollection 2023.'}

Standardized nursing terminologies were developed to enable nursing's voice and perspective to be visible within the healthcare data ecosystem. The use of these SNTs has been shown to improve care quality and outcomes, and to provide data for knowledge discovery. The role of SNTs in describing assessments and interventions and measuring outcomes is unique in health care, and synergistic with the purpose and goals of FHIR. FHIR acknowledges nursing as a discipline of interest and yet the use of SNTs within the FHIR ecosystem is rare. The purpose of this article is to describe FHIR, SNTs, and the potential for synergy in the use of SNTs with FHIR. Toward improving understanding how FHIR works to transport and store knowledge and how SNTs work to convey meaning, we provide a framework and examples of SNTs and their coding for use within FHIR solutions.

However, the accuracy of a GL String is dependent on the reference database version under which it was generated.

GLSC is a defined syntax for exchanging GL Strings in the context of a specific gene-family namespace, allele-name code-system, and pertinent reference database version.

The ostensive information architecture adopts a consensus-based approach initiated from the perspective of information systems re-design and can be applied to other domains where information exchange is required between heterogeneous systems. Driven by the issues in FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) implementation, an ostensive approach that supplements the current lexical approach in semantic exchange is proposed. A Semantic Engine with an FHIR knowledge graph as the core is constructed using Neo4j to provide semantic interpretation and examples. The MIMIC III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) datasets and diabetes datasets have been employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed information architecture.

The system provides cancer patients with coaching advice and supports their clinicians with suitable decisions based on clinical guidelines. OBJECTIVES: As in many multi-agent systems we needed to coordinate the activities of all agents involved. Moreover, since the agents share a common blackboard where all patients' data are stored, we also needed to implement a mechanism for the prompt notification of each agent upon addition of new information potentially triggering its activation. METHODS: The communication needs have been investigated and modeled using the HL7-FHIR (Health Level 7-Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard to ensure proper semantic interoperability among agents. Then a syntax rooted in the FHIR search framework has been defined for representing the conditions to be monitored on the system blackboard for activating each agent. RESULTS: The Case Manager (CM) has been implemented as a dedicated component playing the role of an orchestrator directing the behavior of all agents involved. Agents dynamically inform the CM about the conditions to be monitored on the blackboard, using the syntax we developed. The CM then notifies each agent whenever any condition of interest occurs. The functionalities of the CM and other actors have been validated using simulated scenarios mimicking the ones that will be faced during pilot studies and in production. CONCLUSION: The CM proved to be a key facilitator for properly achieving the required behavior of our multi-agent system. The proposed architecture may also be leveraged in many clinical contexts for integrating separate legacy services, turning them into a consistent telemedicine framework and enabling application reusability.", 'CI': ['The Author(s).

Since QoL cannot be collected exclusively via sensor values, a combination of PROs and PGD is necessary.

It enables monitoring of biomarkers using smart devices from the internet of medical things (IoMT) for the target group. The collected data from such devices can be used to optimize and adjust treatment in a patient in the loop manner. To this end, providers such as Google Fit and Withings have been connected to the platform as example data sources.

The configuration and control of the personalized treatment processes are achieved using a self-developed domain-specific language. For this language, an associated diagram editor was implemented, which allows the management of the treatment processes through graphical models. This graphical representation should help treatment providers to understand and manage these processes more easily. To investigate this hypothesis, a usability study was conducted with twelve participants. We were able to show that such graphical representations provide advantages in clarity in reviewing the system, but lack in easy set-up (compared to wizard-style systems).", 'FAU': ['Schinle, Markus', 'Dietrich, Michael', 'Stock, Simon', 'Gerdes, Marius', 'Stork, Wilhelm'], 'AU': ['Schinle M', 'Dietrich M', 'Stock S', 'Gerdes M', 'Stork W'], 'AD': ['FZI Research Center for Information Technologies, Germany.', 'FZI Research Center for Information Technologies, Germany.', 'KIT Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.', 'KIT Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.', 'KIT Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'PL': 'Netherlands', 'TA': 'Stud Health Technol Inform', 'JT': 'Studies in health technology and informatics', 'JID': '9214582', 'MH': ['Humans', '*Alzheimer Disease', 'Risk Factors', 'Language', 'Data Collection', 'Palliative Care'], 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ["Alzheimer's disease", 'FHIR', 'IoMT', 'digital prevention', 'internet of medical things', 'model-driven intervention planning', 'precision care', 'treatment platform'], 'EDAT': '2023/05/19 06:42', 'MHDA': '2023/05/22 06:42', 'CRDT': ['2023/05/19 05:28'], 'PHST': ['2023/05/22 06:42 [medline]', '2023/05/19 06:42 [pubmed]', '2023/05/19 05:28 [entrez]'], 'AID': ['SHTI230313 [pii]', '10.3233/SHTI230313 [doi]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Stud Health Technol Inform. 2023 May 18;302:937-941. doi: 10.3233/SHTI230313.'}

Accommodating an extensive array of stakeholders, which includes patients, doctors, hospitals, and laboratories, demands interoperability to serve scalable services. FHIR frameworks have played a vital role in e-Healthcare designs. Most of the existing HL7-FHIR frameworks have used REST-API using HTTP-query for CRUD tasks that impose numerous rules and constraints, making the process more complex and time-consuming, violating the quality-of-service (QoS) standards on different levels. This paper develops a novel, robust Smart-Contract Authentication Assisted HL7-FHIR framework toward an interoperable e-Healthcare solution. Unlike classical REST API-based FHIR, our proposed method applies a Graph-mapping concept that transforms each resource variable into an equivalent Graph-Mapped Data Structure (GMS), which is subsequently stored in the NoSQL MongoDB database, reducing computational costs and time to meet QoS demands. The proposed model employs three key components, GMS-driven HL7 FHIR Gateway Model, Smart Contract Authentication and Client Model. The Smart Contract function helped verify and authenticate users to ensure privacy and secure EHR exchange. The assessment of the performance of the proposed model reveals a significant reduction in computational time with optimal resource utilization making it a significant and viable option to better the real-world e-Healthcare mechanisms.', 'CI': ['(c) 2023 The Authors.'], 'FAU': ['Sreejith, R', 'Senthil, S'], 'AU': ['Sreejith R', 'Senthil S'], 'AD': ['School of Computer Science and Engineering, REVA University, Bangalore, India.', 'Department of Business Administration, Rajagiri College of Social Sciences (Autonomous), Kochi, India.', 'School of Computer Science and Applications, REVA University, Bangalore, India.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20230403', 'PL': 'England', 'TA': 'Heliyon', 'JT': 'Heliyon', 'JID': '101672560', 'PMC': 'PMC10114202', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['FHIR', 'Graph-API', 'Interoperability', 'Smart contract', 'Telemedicine', 'eHealthcare'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.'], 'EDAT': '2023/04/24 06:42', 'MHDA': '2023/04/24 06:43', 'PMCR': ['2023/04/03'], 'CRDT': ['2023/04/24 03:27'], 'PHST': ['2023/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2023/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2023/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2023/04/24 06:43 [medline]', '2023/04/24 06:42 [pubmed]', '2023/04/24 03:27 [entrez]', '2023/04/03 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['S2405-8440(23)02387-3 [pii]', 'e15180 [pii]', '10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e15180 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Heliyon. 2023 Apr 3;9(4):e15180. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e15180. eCollection 2023 Apr.'}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dedicated expert group participating in the German Medical Informatics Initiative reviewed information contained in MolGen reports, determined the key elements, and formulated a dataset definition. HL7's Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide (IG) was adopted as a basis for the FHIR(R) specification which was subjected to a public ballot. In addition, elements in the MolGen dataset were mapped to the fields defined in ISO/TS 20428:2017 standard to evaluate compliance. RESULTS: A core dataset of 76 data elements, clustered into 6 categories was created to represent all key information of German MolGen reports. Based on this, a FHIR specification with 16 profiles, 14 derived from HL7(R)'s Genomics Reporting IG and 2 additional profiles (of the FamilyMemberHistory and RiskAssessment resources), was developed. Five example resource bundles show how our adaptation of an international standard can be used to model MolGen report data that was requested following oncological or rare disease indications. Furthermore, the map of the MolGen report data elements to the fields defined by the ISO/TC 20428:2017 standard, confirmed the presence of the majority of required fields.

There are several, one of the methods to prevent prescription errors is the use of a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system. One of the obstacles of implementing this system is improper design and non-compliance with user needs. one of the issues that should be considered in designing information systems is having a standard minimum data set (MDS). Although many computerized physicians order entry (CPOE) systems have been developed in the world, no study has identified the necessary data and minimum data set (MDS) of CPOE system, and published the process of creating this MDS. This study aimed to develop an MDS for cardiovascular CPOE and standardize it with Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). A multi-method approach including systematic review for identifying data elements of CPOE, reviewing the content of medical records, validation of the data elements using the expert panel and, determination of the necessary data elements using a survey was conducted. Classification of the data elements and mapping them to FHIR were done to facilitate data sharing and integration with the electronic health record (EHR) system as well as to reduce data diversity. The final data elements of MDS were categorized into 5 main categories of FHIR (foundation, base, clinical, financial, and specialized) and 146 resources, where possible. Mapping was done by one of the researchers and checked and verified by the second researcher. Non-mapped data elements were added to relevant resources as extensions of existing FHIR resources. In total, 270 data elements were identified from the systematic review. After reviewing the content of 20 patients' medical records, 28 data elements were identified. After combination of data elements of two previous phases and removing duplication, 282 data elements remained. Data elements that were considered necessary to be included in CPOE by conducting a survey among cardiovascular physicians were 109 elements. From 146 resources of FHIR, the data elements of this MDS are covered by 5 resources. This study introduced an MDS for cardiovascular CPOE by combining suggested data elements of previous research, and the practical and local requirements identified in patients' medical records. To facilitate data sharing and integration with EHR, reduce data diversity, and also to categorize data, this MDS was standardized with FHIR. The steps we used to develop this MDS could be a model for creating MDS in other CPOEs and health information systems. This is the first time that the process of developing an MDS for cardiovascular CPOE has been presented in the literature.", 'CI': ['(c) 2023.

Expert-opinion-based precision oncology initiatives are epitomized in Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs), which process large volumes of clinical-genomic data to match genotypes with molecularly guided therapies. METHODS: We used the Johns Hopkins University MTB as a use case and developed a precision oncology core data model (Precision-DM) to capture key clinical-genomic data elements. We leveraged existing CDMs, building upon the Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements model (mCODE). Our model was defined as a set of profiles with multiple data elements, focusing on next-generation sequencing and variant annotations. Most elements were mapped to terminologies or code sets and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). We subsequently compared our Precision-DM with existing CDMs, including the National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons (NCI GDC), mCODE, OSIRIS, the clinical Genome Data Model (cGDM), and the genomic CDM (gCDM). RESULTS: Precision-DM contained 16 profiles and 355 data elements. 39% of the elements derived values from selected terminologies or code sets, and 61% were mapped to FHIR. Although we used most elements contained in mCODE, we significantly expanded the profiles to include genomic annotations, resulting in a partial overlap of 50.7% between our core model and mCODE. Limited overlap was noted between Precision-DM and OSIRIS (33.2%), NCI GDC (21.4%), cGDM (9.3%), and gCDM (7.9%). Precision-DM covered most of the mCODE elements (87.7%), with less coverage for OSIRIS (35.8%), NCI GDC (11%), cGDM (26%) and gCDM (33.3%). CONCLUSION: Precision-DM supports clinical-genomic data standardization to support the MTB use case and may allow for harmonized data pulls across health care systems, academic institutions, and community medical centers.", 'FAU': ['Botsis, Taxiarchis', 'Murray, Joseph C', 'Ghanem, Paola', 'Balan, Archana', 'Kernagis, Alexander', 'Hardart, Kent', 'He, Ting', 'Spiker, Jonathan', 'Kreimeyer, Kory', 'Tao, Jessica', 'Baras, Alexander S', 'Yegnasubramanian, Srinivasan', 'Canzoniero, Jenna', 'Anagnostou, Valsamo'], 'AU': ['Botsis T', 'Murray JC', 'Ghanem P', 'Balan A', 'Kernagis A', 'Hardart K', 'He T', 'Spiker J', 'Kreimeyer K', 'Tao J', 'Baras AS', 'Yegnasubramanian S', 'Canzoniero J', 'Anagnostou V'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0001-7848-2570', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6159-7814', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1283-577X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5385-8711', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5055-0399', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6532-4466', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2397-3342', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0744-6606', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1084-6918', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9480-3047'], 'AD': ['Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Pathology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.'], 'CN': ['Johns Hopkins Molecular Tumor Board Investigators'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'GR': ['U01 FD005942/FD/FDA HHS/United States'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."], 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'JCO Clin Cancer Inform', 'JT': 'JCO clinical cancer informatics', 'JID': '101708809', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Humans', '*Neoplasms/therapy', 'Precision Medicine/methods', 'Genomics/methods', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Decision Making'], 'PMC': 'PMC10281442', 'COIS': ['The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this', 'manuscript.

RESULTS: The SMART Text2FHIR Pipeline is an open-source tool, released through standard package managers, and publicly available container images that implement the mappings, enabling ready conversion of clinical text to FHIR. DISCUSSION: With the increased data liquidity because of new interoperability regulations, NLP processes that can output FHIR can enable a common language for transporting structured and unstructured data.

GenoMed4All is one such project, with the goal of connecting European clinical and -omics data repositories on rare diseases through a federated learning platform. Currently, the consortium faces the challenge of a lack of well-established international datasets and interoperability standards for federated learning applications on rare diseases. This paper presents our practical approach to select and implement a Common Data Model (CDM) suitable for the federated training of predictive models applied to the medical domain, during the initial design phase of our federated learning platform. We describe our selection process, composed of identifying the consortium's needs, reviewing our functional and technical architecture specifications, and extracting a list of business requirements. We review the state of the art and evaluate three widely-used approaches (FHIR, OMOP and Phenopackets) based on a checklist of requirements and specifications. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach considering the use cases specific to our consortium as well as the generic issues of implementing a European federated learning healthcare platform. A list of lessons learned from the experience in our consortium is discussed, from the importance of establishing the proper communication channels for all stakeholders to technical aspects related to -omics data. For federated learning projects focused on secondary use of health data for predictive modeling, encompassing multiple data modalities, a phase of data model convergence is sorely needed to gather different data representations developed in the context of medical research, interoperability of clinical care software, imaging, and -omics analysis into a coherent, unified data model.

Yet, big data and AI oftentimes cannot unlock their full potential at scale, owing to nonstandardized data formats, lack of technical and semantic data interoperability, and limited cooperation between stakeholders in the health care system. Despite the existence of standardized data formats for the medical domain, such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), their prevalence and usability for AI remain limited. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we developed a data harmonization pipeline (DHP) for clinical data sets relying on the common FHIR data standard. METHODS: We validated the performance and usability of our FHIR-DHP with data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. RESULTS: We present the FHIR-DHP workflow in respect of the transformation of "raw" hospital records into a harmonized, AI-friendly data representation. The pipeline consists of the following 5 key preprocessing steps: querying of data from hospital database, FHIR mapping, syntactic validation, transfer of harmonized data into the patient-model database, and export of data in an AI-friendly format for further medical applications. A detailed example of FHIR-DHP execution was presented for clinical diagnoses records. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach enables the scalable and needs-driven data modeling of large and heterogenous clinical data sets.

The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles have been conceptualized to enable data interoperability. Many studies provide implementation guidelines, assessment metrics, and software to achieve FAIR-compliant data, especially for health data sets. Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a health data content modeling and exchange standard. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to devise a new methodology to extract, transform, and load existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR repositories in line with FAIR principles, develop a Data Curation Tool to implement the methodology, and evaluate it on health data sets from 2 different but complementary institutions. We aimed to increase the level of compliance with FAIR principles of existing health data sets through standardization and facilitate health data sharing by eliminating the associated technical barriers. METHODS: Our approach automatically processes the capabilities of a given FHIR end point and directs the user while configuring mappings according to the rules enforced by FHIR profile definitions. Code system mappings can be configured for terminology translations through automatic use of FHIR resources. The validity of the created FHIR resources can be automatically checked, and the software does not allow invalid resources to be persisted. At each stage of our data transformation methodology, we used particular FHIR-based techniques so that the resulting data set could be evaluated as FAIR. We performed a data-centric evaluation of our methodology on health data sets from 2 different institutions. RESULTS: Through an intuitive graphical user interface, users are prompted to configure the mappings into FHIR resource types with respect to the restrictions of selected profiles. Once the mappings are developed, our approach can syntactically and semantically transform existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR without loss of data utility according to our privacy-concerned criteria. In addition to the mapped resource types, behind the scenes, we create additional FHIR resources to satisfy several FAIR criteria. According to the data maturity indicators and evaluation methods of the FAIR Data Maturity Model, we achieved the maximum level (level 5) for being Findable, Accessible, and Interoperable and level 3 for being Reusable. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and extensively evaluated our data transformation approach to unlock the value of existing health data residing in disparate data silos to make them available for sharing according to the FAIR principles. We showed that our method can successfully transform existing health data sets into HL7 FHIR without loss of data utility, and the result is FAIR in terms of the FAIR Data Maturity Model. We support institutional migration to HL7 FHIR, which not only leads to FAIR data sharing but also eases the integration with different research networks.', 'CI': ['(c)A Anil Sinaci, Mert Gencturk, Huseyin Alper Teoman, Gokce Banu Laleci Erturkmen,', 'Celia Alvarez-Romero, Alicia Martinez-Garcia, Beatriz Poblador-Plou, Jonas', 'Carmona-Pirez, Matthias Lobe, Carlos Luis Parra-Calderon.

The FHIR is based on modern web technologies such as HTTP, XML, and JSON and would be capable of overcoming the shortcomings of the previous standards and supporting modern smart devices. Therefore, the FHIR standard could help the healthcare industry to avail the latest technologies benefits and improve data interoperability. The data representation and mapping from the legacy data standards (i.e., HL7 v2 and EHR) to the FHIR is necessary for the healthcare sector. However, direct data mapping or conversion from the traditional data standards to the FHIR data standard is challenging because of the nature and formats of the data. Therefore, in this article, we propose a framework that aims to convert proprietary EHR messages into the HL7 v2 format and apply an unsupervised clustering approach using the DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) algorithm to automatically group a variety of these HL7 v2 messages regardless of their semantic origins. The proposed framework's implementation lays the groundwork to provide a generic mapping model with multi-point and multi-format data conversion input into the FHIR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A method of analysis, the FHIR Interoperability Table (FHIT), is proposed. The FHIT involves the concept of a "catchment," the type or category of data that a profile is intended to represent. The solution first aligns sender and/or receiver profiles according to their catchments, then determines the relationship between the admittances of those profiles, and finally interprets the relationship in terms of the feasibility of data exchange. RESULTS: The FHIT method is demonstrated by analyzing the FHIR-based exchange between the US Core IG and the International Patient Summary IG. DISCUSSION: The last few years have witnessed a significant growth in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), resulting in several major versions of FHIR, hundreds of IGs, and thousands of FHIR profiles. Previous work and available tools have not fully addressed the problem of interoperability between clients and servers that support different FHIR resources, profiles, and versions. CONCLUSION: Application of the proposed methodology allows interoperability problems in FHIR networks to be identified. In some cases, new profiles that resolve those conflicts can be derived, using intersections of the original profiles.

The electronic health records are stored in FHIR((R)) (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) format, the current leading standard for healthcare data exchange. For the genomic data, we perform variant calling on long-read PacBio HiFi data using Cromwell on Azure. Both data formats are parsed, processed and merged in a single scalable pipeline which securely performs tertiary analyses using cloud-based Jupyter notebooks. We include three example applications: exporting patient information to a database, clustering patients and performing a simple pharmacogenomic study.

The present work has been developed in the context of the German Medical Informatics Initiative, where 29 university hospitals agreed to the usage of the Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for their newly established data integration centers. This standard is optimized to describe and exchange medical data but less suitable for standard statistical analysis which mostly requires tabular data formats. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to establish a tool that makes FHIR data accessible for standard statistical analysis by providing means to retrieve and transform data from a FHIR server. The tool should be implemented in a programming environment known to most data analysts and offer functions with variable degrees of flexibility and automation catering to users with different levels of FHIR expertise. METHODS: We propose the fhircrackr framework, which allows downloading and flattening FHIR resources for data analysis. The framework supports different download and authentication protocols and gives the user full control over the data that is extracted from the FHIR resources and transformed into tables. We implemented it using the programming language R [1] and published it under the GPL-3 open source license. RESULTS: The framework was successfully applied to both publicly available test data and real-world data from several ongoing studies. While the processing of larger real-world data sets puts a considerable burden on computation time and memory consumption, those challenges can be attenuated with a number of suitable measures like parallelization and temporary storage mechanisms. CONCLUSION: The fhircrackr R package provides an open source solution within an environment that is familiar to most data scientists and helps overcome the practical challenges that still hamper the usage of EHR data for research.', 'CI': ['The Author(s).

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop integration mechanisms among the various health information systems. The aim of this review was to investigate the interoperability requirements for heterogeneous health information systems and to summarize and present them. METHODS: In accordance with the PRISMA guideline, a broad electronic search of all literature was conducted on the topic through six databases, including PubMed, Web of science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Embase to 25 July 2022. The inclusion criteria were to select English-written articles available in full text with the closest objectives. 36 articles were selected for further analysis. RESULTS: Interoperability has been raised in the field of health information systems from 2003 and now it is one of the topics of interest to researchers. The projects done in this field are mostly in the national scope and to achieve the electronic health record. HL7 FHIR, CDA, HIPAA and SNOMED-CT, SOA, RIM, XML, API, JAVA and SQL are among the most important requirements for implementing interoperability. In order to guarantee the concept of data exchange, semantic interaction is the best choice because the systems can recognize and process semantically similar information homogeneously. CONCLUSIONS: The health industry has become more complex and has new needs. Interoperability meets this needs by communicating between the output and input of processor systems and making easier to access the data in the required formats.', 'CI': ['(c) 2023.

Additionally, generate and publish an openly available demo of the resources, and create a FHIR Implementation Guide to support and clarify the usage of MIMIC-IV on FHIR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FHIR profiles and terminology system of MIMIC-IV were modeled from the base FHIR R4 resources. Data and terminology were reorganized from the relational structure into FHIR according to the profiles. Resources generated were validated for conformance with the FHIR profiles. Finally, FHIR resources were published as newline delimited JSON files and the profiles were packaged into an implementation guide. RESULTS: The modeling of MIMIC-IV in FHIR resulted in 25 profiles, 2 extensions, 35 ValueSets, and 34 CodeSystems. An implementation guide encompassing the FHIR modeling can be accessed at mimic.mit.edu/fhir/mimic. The generated demo dataset contained 100 patients and over 915 000 resources. The full dataset contained 315 000 patients covering approximately 5 840 000 resources. The final datasets in NDJSON format are accessible on PhysioNet. DISCUSSION: Our work highlights the challenges and benefits of generating a real-world FHIR store. The challenges arise from terminology mapping and profiling modeling decisions. The benefits come from the extensively validated openly accessible data created as a result of the modeling work. CONCLUSION: The newly created MIMIC-IV on FHIR provides one of the first accessible deidentified critical care FHIR datasets. The extensive real-world data found in MIMIC-IV on FHIR will be invaluable for research and the development of healthcare applications.', 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2023.

The SCORTEN and ABCD-10 scoring systems have been used as predictive clinical tools for assessing this risk. However, some of the metrics required in calculating these scores, such as the total body surface area (TBSA) involvement, are difficult to calculate. In addition, TBSA involvement is calculated in a variety of ways and is observer dependent and subjective. The goal of this study was to develop an alternative method to predict mortality in patients with SJS/TEN. METHODS: Data was split into training and test datasets and preprocessed. Models were trained using five-fold cross validation. Out of several possible candidates, a random forests model was evaluated as being the most robust in predictive power for this dataset. Upon feature selection, a final random forests model was developed which was used for comparison against SCORTEN. RESULTS: The differences in both accuracy (p = 0.324) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (p = 0.318) between the final random forests model and the SCORTEN and ABCD-10 models were not statistically significant. As such, this alternative method performs similarly to SCORTEN while only requiring simple laboratory tests from the day of admission. DISCUSSION: This new alternative can make the mortality prediction process more efficient, along with providing a seamless implementation of the patient laboratory tests directly into the model from existing electronic health record (EHR) systems. Once the model was developed, a web application was built to deploy the model which integrates with the Epic EHR system on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Application Programming Interface (API); this only requires the patient medical record number and a date of the lab tests as parameters. This model ultimately allows clinicians to calculate patient mortality risk with only a few clicks.

The Independent Trusted Third-Party (TTP) of the University Medicine Greifswald supports data protection-compliant data processing and provides the consent management solutions gICS. METHODS: Based on a stakeholder dialogue a required set of FHIR-functionalities was identified and technically specified supported by official FHIR experts. Next, a "TTP-FHIR Gateway" for the HL7 FHIR-compliant exchange of consent information using gICS was implemented. A last step included external integration tests and the development of a pre-configured consent template for the BC for the NUM sites. RESULTS: A FHIR-compliant gICS-release and a corresponding consent template for the BC were provided to all NUM sites in June 2021. All FHIR functionalities comply with the already-balloted FHIR consent profiles of the HL7 Working Group Consent Management. The consent template simplifies the technical BC rollout and the corresponding implementation of the TFCI interoperability concept at the NUM sites. CONCLUSIONS: This article shows that a HL7 FHIR-compliant and interoperable nationwide exchange of consent information could be built using of the consent management software gICS and the provided TTP-FHIR Gateway. The initial functional scope of the solution covers the requirements identified in the NUM-CODEX setting. The semantic correctness of these functionalities was validated by project-partners from the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich. The production rollout of the solution package to all NUM sites has started successfully.', 'CI': ['(c) 2022.

To promote patient-centered care, data from these apps must be integrated into clinician workflows within the electronic health record (EHR). Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) offers a standards-based application programming interface (API) that may support such integration. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use interoperability standards to integrate a patient mobile application (coronavirus 2019 [COVID-19] Tracker) with an EHR. The COVID-19 Tracker engages patients by sending introductory and reminder text messages, collecting vital signs and symptom data from COVID-19 patients, and providing actionable guidance if concerning issues are identified. This case report explored the use of FHIR APIs to integrate the app into EHR-enabled clinical workflows. METHODS: The authors used notes from project meetings and from semistructured discussions among the application development team to track the design and implementation processes. Seven points of integration between the application and the EHR were identified, and approaches using FHIR to perform these integrations were delineated. RESULTS: Although this clinical decision support integration project benefited from its standards-based approach, many challenges were encountered. These were due to (1) partial implementation of the FHIR standard in the EHR, particularly, components needed for patient engagement applications; (2) limited experience with the adoption of FHIR standards; and (3) gaps in the current FHIR standard. Alternative approaches, often not based on interoperability standards, were developed to overcome these limitations. CONCLUSION: Despite the challenges encountered due to the early stages of FHIR development and adoption, FHIR standards provide a promising mechanism for overcoming longstanding barriers and facilitating the integration of patient engagement apps with EHRs. To accelerate the integration of apps into clinical workflows, additional components of the FHIR standard must be implemented within the EHR and other clinical systems. Continued expansion of available FHIR resources will help with tighter workflow integration.', 'CI': ['The Author(s).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of 33 preexisting phenotype definitions used in research that are represented using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) was analyzed using automated analysis of the computable representation of the CQL libraries. RESULTS: Most of the phenotype definitions include narrative descriptions and flowcharts, while few provide pseudocode or executable artifacts. Most use 4 or fewer medical terminologies. The number of codes used ranges from 5 to 6865, and value sets from 1 to 19. We found that the most common expressions used were literal, data, and logical expressions. Aggregate and arithmetic expressions are the least common. Expression depth ranges from 4 to 27. DISCUSSION: Despite the range of conditions, we found that all of the phenotype definitions consisted of logical criteria, representing both clinical and operational logic, and tabular data, consisting of codes from standard terminologies and keywords for natural language processing. The total number and variety of expressions are low, which may be to simplify implementation, or authors may limit complexity due to data availability constraints. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype definitions analyzed show significant variation in specific logical, arithmetic, and other operators but are all composed of the same high-level components, namely tabular data and logical expressions. A standard representation for phenotype definitions should support these formats and be modular to support localization and shared logic.', 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2022.

The use of HL7 FHIR, openEHR, IHE XDS, and SNOMED CT (FOXS) together represents a specification to create an open digital health platform for modern health care applications. OBJECTIVES: To describe where logical FOXS components align to the European Open Science Cloud Interoperability Framework (EOSC-IF) reference architecture for semantic interoperability. This should provide a means of defining if FOXS aligns to FAIR principles and to establish the data models and structures that support longitudinal care records as being fit to underpin scientific research. METHODS: The EOSC-IF Semantic View is a representation of semantic interoperability where meaning is preserved between systems and users. This was analyzed and cross-referenced with FOXS architectural components, mapping concepts, and objects that describe content such as catalogues and semantic artifacts. RESULTS: Majority of conceptual Semantic View components were featured within the FOXS architecture. Semantic Business Objects are composed of a range of elements such as openEHR archetypes and templates, FHIR resources and profiles, SNOMED CT concepts, and XDS document identifiers. Semantic Functional Content comprises catalogues of metadata that were also supported by openEHR and FHIR tools. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some elements of EOSC-IF being vague (e.g., FAIR Digital Object), there was a broad conformance to the framework concepts and the components of a FOXS platform.

To achieve this goal across the European Union, the EMA set up the DARWIN EU project based on OMOP CDM established by the OHDSI community. The harmonization of heterogeneous local health data in OMOP CDM is an essential step to participate in such networks. Using the widespread communication standard HL7 FHIR can reduce the complexity of the transformation process to OMOP CDM. Enabling German university hospitals to participate in such networks requires an Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)-process that satisfies the following criteria: 1) transforming German patient data from FHIR to OMOP CDM, 2) processing huge amount of data at once and 3) flexibility to cope with changes in FHIR profiles. METHOD: A mapping of German patient data from FHIR to OMOP CDM was accomplished, validated by an interdisciplinary team and checked through the OHDSI Data Quality Dashboard (DQD). To satisfy criteria 2-3, we decided to use SpringBatch-Framework according to its chunk-oriented design and reusable functions for processing large amounts of data. RESULTS: We have successfully developed an ETL-process that fulfills the defined criteria of transforming German patient data from FHIR into OMOP CDM. To measure the validity of the mapping conformance and performance of the ETL-process, it was tested with 392,022 FHIR resources. The ETL execution lasted approximately-one minute and the DQD result shows 99% conformance in OMOP CDM. CONCLUSIONS: Our ETL-process has been successfully tested and integrated at 10 German university hospitals. The data harmonization utilizing international recognized standards like FHIR and OMOP fosters their ability to participate in international observational studies. Additionally, the ETL process can help to prepare more German hospitals with their data harmonization journey based on existing standards.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors.

Establishing a CDS system in a health care setting remains a challenge. A few hospitals have used self-developed in-house CDS systems or commercial CDS solutions. Since these in-house CDS systems tend to be tightly coupled with a specific electronic health record system, the functionality and knowledge base are not easily shareable. A shared interoperable CDS system facilitates the sharing of the knowledge base and extension of CDS services. OBJECTIVE: The study focuses on developing and deploying the national CDS service for the drug-allergy interaction (DAI) check for health care providers in Korea that need to introduce the service but lack the budget and expertise. METHODS: To provide the shared interoperable CDS service, we designed and implemented the system based on the CDS Hooks specification and Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. The study describes the CDS development process. The system development went through requirement analysis, design, implementation, and deployment. In particular, the concept architecture was designed based on the CDS Hooks structure. The MedicationRequest and AllergyIntolerance resources were profiled to exchange data using the FHIR standard. The discovery and DAI check application programming interfaces and rule engine were developed. RESULTS: The CDS service was deployed on G-Cloud, a government cloud service. In March 2021, the CDS service was launched, and 67 health care providers participated in the CDS service. The health care providers participated in the service with 1,008,357 DAI checks for 114,694 patients, of which 33,054 (3.32%) cases resulted in a "warning." CONCLUSIONS: Korea\'s Ministry of Health and Welfare has been trying to build an HL7 FHIR-based ecosystem in Korea. As one of these efforts, the CDS service initiative has been conducted. To promote the rapid adoption of the HL7 FHIR standard, it is necessary to accelerate practical service development and to appeal to policy makers regarding the benefits of FHIR standardization. With the development of various case-specific implementation guides using the Korea Core implementation guide, the FHIR standards will be distributed nationwide, and more shared interoperable health care services will be introduced in Korea.', 'CI': ['(c)Sungwon Jung, Sungchul Bae, Donghyeong Seong, Ock Hee Oh, Yoomi Kim, Byoung-Kee', 'Yi.

Here, starting with university hospitals, a digital infrastructure is currently being established for the data protection-compliant multiple use of standardised care and research data. Since 2020, part of the initiative has been the CORD-MI project (Collaboration on Rare Diseases) in which university hospitals and other partners throughout Germany have joined forces to improve patient care and research in the field of rare diseases.This article highlights how the MII takes into account the concerns of SE and what opportunities the "new routine data" obtained offer. A SE module was included in the "MII core data set" - an information model based on the data standard fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR). Data collected in the context of care and research routines can thus be exchanged between the participating institutions in the future and support, for example, diagnosis, therapy selection and research projects in the field of SE.

One of the key challenges for collaborative research is a lack of interoperability among various heterogeneous data sources. Interoperability, standardization and mapping of datasets are necessary for data analysis and applications in advanced algorithms such as developing personalized risk prediction modeling. RESULTS: To ensure the interoperability and compatibility among COVID-19 datasets, we present here a common data model (CDM) which has been built from 11 different COVID-19 datasets from various geographical locations. The current version of the CDM holds 4639 data variables related to COVID-19 such as basic patient information (age, biological sex and diagnosis) as well as disease-specific data variables, for example, Anosmia and Dyspnea. Each of the data variables in the data model is associated with specific data types, variable mappings, value ranges, data units and data encodings that could be used for standardizing any dataset. Moreover, the compatibility with established data standards like OMOP and FHIR makes the CDM a well-designed CDM for COVID-19 data interoperability.

As the number of early warning systems and artificial intelligence applications increases, health care information exchange and interoperability are becoming more complex and difficult. Although Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) have already developed a vital signs profile, it is not sufficient to support IHCA applications or machine learning-based models. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, for IHCA instances with vital signs, we define a new implementation guide that includes data mapping, a system architecture, a workflow, and FHIR applications. METHODS: We interviewed 10 experts regarding health care system integration and defined an implementation guide. We then developed the FHIR Extract Transform Load to map data to FHIR resources. We also integrated an early warning system and machine learning pipeline. RESULTS: The study data set includes electronic health records of adult inpatients who visited the En-Chu-Kong hospital. Medical staff regularly measured these vital signs at least 2 to 3 times per day during the day, night, and early morning. We used pseudonymization to protect patient privacy. Then, we converted the vital signs to FHIR observations in the JSON format using the FHIR Extract Transform Load application. The measured vital signs include systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. According to clinical requirements, we also extracted the electronic health record information to the FHIR server. Finally, we integrated an early warning system and machine learning pipeline using the FHIR RESTful application programming interface. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully demonstrated a process that standardizes health care information for inpatient deterioration detection using vital signs. Based on the FHIR definition, we also provided an implementation guide that includes data mapping, an integration process, and IHCA assessment using vital signs. We also proposed a clarifying system architecture and possible workflows. Based on FHIR, we integrated the 3 different systems in 1 dashboard system, which can effectively solve the complexity of the system in the medical staff workflow.', 'CI': ['(c)Tzu-Wei Tseng, Chang-Fu Su, Feipei Lai.

The use of health information standards based on the dual model allows the achievement of semantic interoperability among systems. Although there is evidence in the use of the Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (SMART on FHIR) framework for standardized communication between mobile apps and electronic health records (EHRs), the use of European Norm/International Organization for Standardization (EN/ISO) 13606 has not been explored yet, despite some advantages over FHIR in terms of modeling and formalization of clinical knowledge, as well as flexibility in the creation of new concepts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to design and implement a methodology based on the dual-model paradigm to communicate clinical information between a patient mobile app (Xemio Research) and an institutional ontology-based clinical repository (OntoCR) without loss of meaning. METHODS: This paper is framed within Artificial intelligence Supporting CAncer Patients across Europe (ASCAPE), a project that aims to use artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) mechanisms to support cancer patients\' health status and quality of life (QoL). First, the variables "side effect" and "daily steps" were defined and represented with EN/ISO 13606 archetypes. Next, ontologies that model archetyped concepts and map them to the standard were created and uploaded to OntoCR, where they were ready to receive instantiated patient data. Xemio Research used a conversion module in the ASCAPE Local Edge to transform data entered into the app to create EN/ISO 13606 extracts, which were sent to an Application Programming Interface (API) in OntoCR that maps each element in the normalized XML files to its corresponding location in the ontology. This way, instantiated data of patients are stored in the clinical repository. RESULTS: Between December 22, 2020, and April 4, 2022, 1100 extracts of 47 patients were successfully communicated (234/1100, 21.3%, extracts of side effects and 866/1100, 78.7%, extracts of daily activity). Furthermore, the creation of EN/ISO 13606-standardized archetypes allows the reuse of clinical information regarding daily activity and side effects, while with the creation of ontologies, we extended the knowledge representation of our clinical repository. CONCLUSIONS: Health information interoperability is one of the requirements for continuity of health care. The dual model allows the separation of knowledge and information in HISs.

The recently published Health Level Seven (HL7(R)) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR(R)) data exchange standard seeks to improve sIRB operational efficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a study to determine whether the use of this standard would be economically attractive for sIRB workflows collectively and for Reviewing and Relying institutions. We examined four sIRB-associated workflows at a single institution: (1) Initial Study Protocol Application, (2) Site Addition for an Approved sIRB study, (3) Continuing Review, and (4) Medical and Non-Medical Event Reporting. Task-level information identified personnel roles and their associated hour requirements for completion. Tasks that would be eliminated by the data exchange standard were identified. Personnel costs were estimated using annual salaries by role. No tasks would be eliminated in the Initial Study Protocol Application or Medical and Non-Medical Event Reporting workflows through use of the proposed data exchange standard. Site Addition workflow hours would be reduced by 2.50 h per site (from 15.50 to 13.00 h) and Continuing Review hours would be reduced by 9.00 h per site per study year (from 36.50 to 27.50 h). Associated costs savings were $251 for the Site Addition workflow (from $1609 to $1358) and $1033 for the Continuing Review workflow (from $4110 to $3076). CONCLUSION: Use of the proposed HL7 FHIR(R) data exchange standard would be economically attractive for sIRB workflows collectively and for each entity participating in the new workflows.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is the most commonly used standard for annotating phenotypic abnormalities and supporting phenotype-driven analysis of diagnostic exome and genome sequencing. Numerous standards for diseases are available that support a range of needs. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) are the most important standards developed specifically for rare diseases. The Mondo Disease Ontology (Mondo) is a new disease ontology that aims to integrate data from a comprehensive range of current nosologies. New standards and schemas such as the Medical Action Ontology (MAxO) and the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) phenopacket are being introduced to extend the scope of standards that support rare disease research.In order to provide optimal care for patients with SE in different healthcare settings, it will be necessary to better integrate standards for rare disease with electronic healthcare resources such as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for healthcare data exchange.', 'CI': ['(c) 2022.

Owing to existing challenges in data collection, especially for rare disease research, CBER recognized the need for a comprehensive platform where study coordinators can engage with study participants and design and deploy studies while patients or caregivers could enroll, consent, and securely participate as well. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to increase awareness and describe the design, development, and novelty of the Survey of Health and Patient Experience (SHAPE) platform, its functionality and application, quality improvement efforts, open-source availability, and plans for enhancement. METHODS: SHAPE is hosted in a Google Cloud environment and comprises 3 parts: the administrator application, participant app, and application programming interface. The administrator can build a study comprising a set of questionnaires and self-report entries through the app. Once the study is deployed, the participant can access the app, consent to the study, and complete its components. To build SHAPE to be scalable and flexible, we leveraged the open-source software development kit, Ionic Framework. This enabled the building and deploying of apps across platforms, including iOS, Android, and progressive web applications, from a single codebase by using standardized web technologies. SHAPE has been integrated with a leading Health Level 7 (HL7(R)) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR(R)) application programming interface platform, 1upHealth, which allows participants to consent to 1-time data pull of their electronic health records. We used an agile-based process that engaged multiple stakeholders in SHAPE's design and development. RESULTS: SHAPE allows study coordinators to plan, develop, and deploy questionnaires to obtain important end points directly from patients or caregivers. Electronic health record integration enables access to patient health records, which can validate and enhance the accuracy of data-capture methods. The administrator can then download the study data into HL7(R) FHIR(R)-formatted JSON files. In this paper, we illustrate how study coordinators can use SHAPE to design patient-centered studies. We demonstrate its broad applicability through a hypothetical type 1 diabetes cohort study and an ongoing pilot study on metachromatic leukodystrophy to implement best practices for designing a regulatory-grade natural history study for rare diseases. CONCLUSIONS: SHAPE is an intuitive and comprehensive data-collection tool for a variety of clinical studies. Further customization of this versatile and scalable platform allows for multiple use cases. SHAPE can capture patient perspectives and clinical data, thereby providing regulators, clinicians, researchers, and patient advocacy organizations with data to inform drug development and improve patient outcomes.", 'CI': ['(c)Haley Huang, Sofia Aschettino, Nasim Lari, Ting-Hsuan Lee, Sarah Stothers', 'Rosenberg, Xinyi Ng, Stella Muthuri, Anirudh Bakshi, Korrin Bishop, Hussein', 'Ezzeldin.

Constructing clinical knowledge graphs (CKGs) against heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs) has been desired by the research and healthcare AI communities. From the standardization perspective, community-based standards such as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) are increasingly used to represent and standardize EHR data for clinical data analytics, however, the potential of such a standard on building CKG has not been well investigated. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate methods and tools that expose the OMOP CDM-based clinical data repositories into virtual clinical KGs that are compliant with FHIR Resource Description Framework (RDF) specification. METHODS: We developed a system called FHIR-Ontop-OMOP to generate virtual clinical KGs from the OMOP relational databases. We leveraged an OMOP CDM-based Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data repository to evaluate the FHIR-Ontop-OMOP system in terms of the faithfulness of data transformation and the conformance of the generated CKGs to the FHIR RDF specification. RESULTS: A beta version of the system has been released. A total of more than 100 data element mappings from 11 OMOP CDM clinical data, health system and vocabulary tables were implemented in the system, covering 11 FHIR resources. The generated virtual CKG from MIMIC-III contains 46,520 instances of FHIR Patient, 716,595 instances of Condition, 1,063,525 instances of Procedure, 24,934,751 instances of MedicationStatement, 365,181,104 instances of Observations, and 4,779,672 instances of CodeableConcept. Patient counts identified by five pairs of SQL (over the MIMIC database) and SPARQL (over the virtual CKG) queries were identical, ensuring the faithfulness of the data transformation. Generated CKG in RDF triples for 100 patients were fully conformant with the FHIR RDF specification. CONCLUSION: The FHIR-Ontop-OMOP system can expose OMOP database as a FHIR-compliant RDF graph. It provides a meaningful use case demonstrating the potentials that can be enabled by the interoperability between FHIR and OMOP CDM. Generated clinical KGs in FHIR RDF provide a semantic foundation to enable explainable AI applications in healthcare.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: A server implementation was developed, featuring a FHIR API with new operations designed to support exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced patient cohort selection and data preparation tasks. Integration with a FHIR Terminology Service is also supported, allowing users to incorporate knowledge from rich terminologies such as SNOMED CT within their queries. A prototype user interface for EDA was developed, along with visualizations in support of a health data analysis project. CONCLUSIONS: Experience with applying this technology within research projects and towards the development of analytics-enabled applications provides a preliminary indication that the FHIR Analytics API pattern implemented by Pathling is a valuable abstraction for data scientists and software developers within the health care domain.

However, these knowledge sources are only available in unstructured text form and without any contextual link to real patient data. The aim of our project is to give a modeled decision support for the next treatment step based on the actual data and position of a patient. METHODS: First, we identified passages for qualified decision-making necessary at the point of care from the SOP for melanoma. Thereby, the patient-specific contextual reference data at decision points was considered in parallel and represented by FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) resources. The decision algorithm was then formalized using BPMN modeling with FHIR annotations. Validation was provided by medical experts, dermatooncologists from University Hospital Essen. RESULTS: The resulting BPMN model is presented here with the diagnostic procedure of sentinel lymph node excision as the example snippet from the whole algorithm. Each decision point is edited with FHIR resources covering the patient data and preparing the context sensitivity of the model. CONCLUSION: Modeling guideline-based information into a decision algorithm that can be presented at the point of care with contextual reference, may have the potential to support patient-specific clinical decision-making.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide recommendations for suitable interventions regarding different chronic diseases, but a deficiency in the implementation of these CPGs has been identified. The PITeS-TiiSS (Telemedicine and eHealth Innovation Platform: Information Communications Technology for Research and Information Challenges in Health Services) tool, a personalized ontology-based clinical decision support system (CDSS), aims to reduce variability, prevent errors, and consider interactions between different CPG recommendations, among other benefits. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to design, develop, and validate an ontology-based CDSS that provides personalized recommendations related to drug prescription. The target population is older adult patients with chronic diseases and polypharmacy, and the goal is to reduce complications related to these types of conditions while offering integrated care. METHODS: A study scenario about atrial fibrillation and treatment with anticoagulants was selected to validate the tool. After this, a series of knowledge sources were identified, including CPGs, PROFUND index, LESS/CHRON criteria, and STOPP/START criteria, to extract the information. Modeling was carried out using an ontology, and mapping was done with Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT; International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation). Once the CDSS was developed, validation was carried out by using a retrospective case study. RESULTS: This project was funded in January 2015 and approved by the Virgen del Rocio University Hospital ethics committee on November 24, 2015. Two different tasks were carried out to test the functioning of the tool. First, retrospective data from a real patient who met the inclusion criteria were used. Second, the analysis of an adoption model was performed through the study of the requirements and characteristics that a CDSS must meet in order to be well accepted and used by health professionals. The results are favorable and allow the proposed research to continue to the next phase. CONCLUSIONS: An ontology-based CDSS was successfully designed, developed, and validated.

Although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have enabled ubiquitous point-of-care testing in low-resource settings, their impact has been less than anticipated, owing in part to lack of features to streamline data capture and analysis. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to transform the RDT into a tool for PPH by defining information and data axioms and an information utilization index (IUI); identifying design features to maximize the IUI; and producing open guidelines (OGs) for modular RDT features that enable links with digital health tools to create an RDT-OG system. METHODS: We reviewed published papers and conducted a survey with experts or users of RDTs in the sectors of technology, manufacturing, and deployment to define features and axioms for information utilization. We developed an IUI, ranging from 0% to 100%, and calculated this index for 33 World Health Organization-prequalified RDTs. RDT-OG specifications were developed to maximize the IUI; the feasibility and specifications were assessed through developing malaria and COVID-19 RDTs based on OGs for use in Kenya and Indonesia. RESULTS: The survey respondents (n=33) included 16 researchers, 7 technologists, 3 manufacturers, 2 doctors or nurses, and 5 other users. They were most concerned about the proper use of RDTs (30/33, 91%), their interpretation (28/33, 85%), and reliability (26/33, 79%), and were confident that smartphone-based RDT readers could address some reliability concerns (28/33, 85%), and that readers were more important for complex or multiplex RDTs (33/33, 100%). The IUI of prequalified RDTs ranged from 13% to 75% (median 33%). In contrast, the IUI for an RDT-OG prototype was 91%. The RDT open guideline system that was developed was shown to be feasible by (1) creating a reference RDT-OG prototype; (2) implementing its features and capabilities on a smartphone RDT reader, cloud information system, and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; and (3) analyzing the potential public health impact of RDT-OG integration with laboratory, surveillance, and vital statistics systems. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and manufacturers can define, adopt, and synergize with RDT-OGs and digital health initiatives.

However, its full potential has not been realized, mainly due to clinical data standards and noninteroperable platforms. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we introduce the common data model-based intelligent algorithm network environment (CANE) platform that supports the implementation and deployment of a CDSS. METHODS: CDSS reasoning engines, usually represented as R or Python objects, are deployed into the CANE platform and converted into C# objects. When a clinician requests CANE-based decision support in the electronic health record (EHR) system, patients' information is transformed into Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format and transmitted to the CANE server inside the hospital firewall. Upon receiving the necessary data, the CANE system's modules perform the following tasks: (1) the preprocessing module converts the FHIRs into the input data required by the specific reasoning engine, (2) the reasoning engine module operates the target algorithms, (3) the integration module communicates with the other institutions' CANE systems to request and transmit a summary report to aid in decision support, and (4) creates a user interface by integrating the summary report and the results calculated by the reasoning engine. RESULTS: We developed a CANE system such that any algorithm implemented in the system can be directly called through the RESTful application programming interface when it is integrated with an EHR system. Eight algorithms were developed and deployed in the CANE system. Using a knowledge-based algorithm, physicians can screen patients who are prone to sepsis and obtain treatment guides for patients with sepsis with the CANE system. Further, using a nonknowledge-based algorithm, the CANE system supports emergency physicians' clinical decisions about optimum resource allocation by predicting a patient's acuity and prognosis during triage.

However, its use as a standard for health research is still less prevalent. To use existing data sources more efficiently for health research, data interoperability becomes increasingly important. FHIR provides solutions by offering resource domains such as "Public Health & Research" and "Evidence-Based Medicine" while using already established web technologies. Therefore, FHIR could help standardize data across different data sources and improve interoperability in health research. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to provide a systematic review of existing literature and determine the current state of FHIR implementations in health research and possible future directions. METHODS: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published from 2011 to 2022. Studies investigating the use of FHIR in health research were included. Articles published before 2011, abstracts, reviews, editorials, and expert opinions were excluded. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and registered this study with PROSPERO (CRD42021235393). Data synthesis was done in tables and figures. RESULTS: We identified a total of 998 studies, of which 49 studies were eligible for inclusion. Of the 49 studies, most (73%, n=36) covered the domain of clinical research, whereas the remaining studies focused on public health or epidemiology (6%, n=3) or did not specify their research domain (20%, n=10). Studies used FHIR for data capture (29%, n=14), standardization of data (41%, n=20), analysis (12%, n=6), recruitment (14%, n=7), and consent management (4%, n=2). Most (55%, 27/49) of the studies had a generic approach, and 55% (12/22) of the studies focusing on specific medical specialties (infectious disease, genomics, oncology, environmental health, imaging, and pulmonary hypertension) reported their solutions to be conferrable to other use cases. Most (63%, 31/49) of the studies reported using additional data models or terminologies: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (29%, n=14), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (37%, n=18), International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (18%, n=9), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (12%, n=6), and others (43%, n=21). Only 4 (8%) studies used a FHIR resource from the domain "Public Health & Research." Limitations using FHIR included the possible change in the content of FHIR resources, safety, legal matters, and the need for a FHIR server. CONCLUSIONS: Our review found that FHIR can be implemented in health research, and the areas of application are broad and generalizable in most use cases. The implementation of international terminologies was common, and other standards such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model could be used as a complement to FHIR. Limitations such as the change of FHIR content, lack of FHIR implementation, safety, and legal matters need to be addressed in future releases to expand the use of FHIR and, therefore, interoperability in health research.', 'CI': ['(c)Carina Nina Vorisek, Moritz Lehne, Sophie Anne Ines Klopfenstein, Paula', 'Josephine Mayer, Alexander Bartschke, Thomas Haese, Sylvia Thun.

We conducted a scoping review to identify trends and gaps in the use of FHIR for clinical research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed published literature, federally funded project databases, application websites, and other sources to discover FHIR-based papers, projects, and tools (collectively, "FHIR projects") available to support clinical research activities. RESULTS: Our search identified 203 different FHIR projects applicable to clinical research. Most were associated with preparations to conduct research, such as data mapping to and from FHIR formats (n = 66, 32.5%) and managing ontologies with FHIR (n = 30, 14.8%), or post-study data activities, such as sharing data using repositories or registries (n = 24, 11.8%), general research data sharing (n = 23, 11.3%), and management of genomic data (n = 21, 10.3%). With the exception of phenotyping (n = 19, 9.4%), fewer FHIR-based projects focused on needs within the clinical research process itself. DISCUSSION: Funding and usage of FHIR-enabled solutions for research are expanding, but most projects appear focused on establishing data pipelines and linking clinical systems such as electronic health records, patient-facing data systems, and registries, possibly due to the relative newness of FHIR and the incentives for FHIR integration in health information systems. Fewer FHIR projects were associated with research-only activities. CONCLUSION: The FHIR standard is becoming an essential component of the clinical research enterprise. To develop FHIR\'s full potential for clinical research, funding and operational stakeholders should address gaps in FHIR-based research tools and methods.', 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2022.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed an open-source, standards-compliant phenotyping tool known as the PhEMA Workbench that enables a phenotype representation using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) standards. We then demonstrated how this tool can be used to conduct EHR-based phenotyping, including phenotype authoring, execution, and validation. We validated the performance of the tool by executing a thrombotic event phenotype definition at 3 sites, Mayo Clinic (MC), Northwestern Medicine (NM), and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), and used manual review to determine precision and recall. RESULTS: An initial version of the PhEMA Workbench has been released, which supports phenotype authoring, execution, and publishing to a shared phenotype definition repository. The resulting thrombotic event phenotype definition consisted of 11 CQL statements, and 24 value sets containing a total of 834 codes. Technical validation showed satisfactory performance (both NM and MC had 100% precision and recall and WCM had a precision of 95% and a recall of 84%). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the PhEMA Workbench can facilitate EHR-driven phenotype definition, execution, and phenotype sharing in heterogeneous clinical research data environments. A phenotype definition that integrates with existing standards-compliant systems, and the use of a formal representation facilitates automation and can decrease potential for human error.', 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2022.

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) is an open global standard that facilitates structuring of health information for coordinated exchange among stakeholders. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to design FHIR profiles and present methodology and the profiled FHIR resource for Maternal and Child Health referral use cases in Ebonyi state, Nigeria-a typical low- and middle-income country (LMIC) setting. METHODS: Practicing doctors, midwives, and nurses were purposefully sampled and surveyed. Different referral forms were reviewed. The union of data sets from surveys and forms was aggregated and mapped to base patient FHIR resource elements, and extensions were created for data sets not in the core FHIR specification. This study also introduced FHIR and its relation to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) International Classification of Diseases. RESULTS: We found many different data elements from the referral forms and survey responses even in urban settings. The resulting FHIR standard profile is published on GitHub for adaptation or adoption as necessary to aid alignment with WHO recommendations. Understanding data sets used in health care and clinical practice for information sharing is crucial in properly standardizing information sharing, particularly during the management of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Development organizations and governments can use this methodology and profile to fast-track FHIR standards adoption for paper and electronic information sharing at PHC systems in LMICs. CONCLUSIONS: We presented our methodology for profiling the referral resource crucial for the standardized exchange of new and expectant moms' information. Using data from frontline providers and mapping to the FHIR profile helped contextualize the standardized profile.", 'CI': ['(c)Emeka Chukwu, Lalit Garg, Nkiruka Obande-Ogbuinya, Vijay Kumar Chattu.', 'Originally published in JMIR Formative Research (https://formative.jmir.org),', '07.07.2022.'], 'FAU': ['Chukwu, Emeka', 'Garg, Lalit', 'Obande-Ogbuinya, Nkiruka', 'Chattu, Vijay Kumar'], 'AU': ['Chukwu E', 'Garg L', 'Obande-Ogbuinya N', 'Chattu VK'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0003-3474-8108', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3868-0481', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2033-5655', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9840-8335'], 'AD': ['Department of Computer Information Systems, Faculty of Information Communication Technology, University of Malta, Msida, Malta.', 'Digital Health Interoperability Network, Abuja, Nigeria.', 'Department of Computer Information Systems, Faculty of Information Communication Technology, University of Malta, Msida, Malta.', 'Department of Science Education, Alex-Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike, Ikwo, Ebonyi, Nigeria.', 'Department of Occupational Science & Occupational Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Center for Transdisciplinary Research, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technological Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, India.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, India.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20220707', 'PL': 'Canada', 'TA': 'JMIR Form Res', 'JT': 'JMIR formative research', 'JID': '101726394', 'PMC': 'PMC9305397', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['BlockMom', 'COVID-19', 'FHIR', 'Nigeria', 'digital health', 'eHealth', 'health information', 'health information exchange', 'interoperability', 'mHealth', 'primary health care'], 'COIS': ['Conflicts of Interest: None declared.'], 'EDAT': '2022/07/08 06:00', 'MHDA': '2022/07/08 06:01', 'PMCR': ['2022/07/07'], 'CRDT': ['2022/07/07 11:52'], 'PHST': ['2021/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2022/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2022/07/07 11:52 [entrez]', '2022/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/07/08 06:01 [medline]', '2022/07/07 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['v6i7e28510 [pii]', '10.2196/28510 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'JMIR Form Res. 2022 Jul 7;6(7):e28510. doi: 10.2196/28510.'}

Achieving semantic interoperability is the first step to enable reuse of healthcare data. To ensure interoperability, metadata repositories (MDR) are increasingly used to manage data elements on a structural level, while terminology servers (TS) manage the ontologies, terminologies, coding systems and value sets on a semantic level. In practice, however, this strict separation is not always followed; instead, semantical information is stored and maintained directly in the MDR, as a link between both systems is missing. This may be reasonable up to a certain level of complexity, but it quickly reaches its limitations with increasing complexity. The goal of this approach is to combine both components in a compatible manner.

METHODS: The harmonized depression outcome measures selected for this project were response, remission, recurrence, suicide ideation and behavior, adverse effects of treatment, and death from suicide. The measures were calculated in the PRIME Registry, sponsored by the American Board of Family Medicine, and PsychPRO, sponsored by the American Psychiatric Association, and displayed on the registry dashboards for the participating pilot sites. At the conclusion of the data collection period (March 2020-March 2021), registry data were analyzed to describe implementation of measurement-based care and outcomes in the primary care and behavioral health care settings. To calculate and display the measures in the health system setting, a Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technology (SMART) on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) application was developed and deployed at Baystate Health. Finally a stakeholder panel was convened to develop a prioritized research agenda for PCOR in depression and to provide feedback on the development of a data use and governance toolkit. RESULTS: Calculation of the harmonized outcome measures within the PRIME Registry and PsychPRO was feasible, but technical and operational barriers needed to be overcome to ensure that relevant data were available and that the measures were meaningful to clinicians. Analysis of the registry data demonstrated that the harmonized outcome measures can be used to support PCOR across care settings and data sources. In the health system setting, this project demonstrated that it is technically and operationally feasible to use an open-source app to calculate and display the outcome measures in the clinician's workflow. Finally, this project produced tools and resources to support future implementations of harmonized measures and use of the resulting data for research, including a prioritized research agenda and data use and governance toolkit. CONCLUSION: Standardization of outcome measures across patient registries and routine clinical care is an important step toward creating robust, national-level data infrastructure that could serve as the foundation for learning health systems, quality improvement initiatives, and research. This project demonstrated that it is feasible to calculate the harmonized outcome measures for depression in two patient registries and a health system setting, display the results to clinicians to support individual patient management and population health, and use the outcome measures data to support research. This project also assessed the value and burden of capturing the measures in different care settings and created standards-based tools and other resources to support future implementations of harmonized outcome measures in depression and other clinical areas. The findings and lessons learned from this project should serve as a roadmap to guide future implementations of harmonized outcome measures in depression and other clinical areas.", 'FAU': ['Leavy, Michelle B', 'Boussios, Costas', 'Phillips, Robert L Jr', 'Clarke, Diana', 'Sarvet, Barry', 'Boxwala, Aziz', 'Gliklich, Richard'], 'AU': ['Leavy MB', 'Boussios C', 'Phillips RL Jr', 'Clarke D', 'Sarvet B', 'Boxwala A', 'Gliklich R'], 'AD': ['OM1, Inc.', 'OM1, Inc.', 'American Board of Family Medicine', 'American Psychiatric Association', 'Baystate Health', 'Elimu Informatics', 'OM1, Inc.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Review', 'Book'], 'PL': 'Rockville (MD)', 'EDAT': '2022/06/01 00:00', 'CRDT': ['2022/06/01 00:00'], 'AID': ['NBK581920 [bookaccession]', '10.23970/AHRQEPCWHITEPAPERDEPRESSIONFINAL [doi]']}

The existing literature shows different methods to overcome this problem. Fast healthcare interoperable resources (FHIR) as a structural standard may explain other information models, (e.g., personal, physiological, and behavioral data from heterogeneous sources, such as activity sensors, questionnaires, and interviews) with semantic vocabularies, (e.g., Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)) to connect personal health data to an electronic health record (EHR). We design and develop an intuitive health coaching (eCoach) smartphone application to prove the concept. We combine HL7 FHIR and SNOMED-CT vocabularies to exchange personal health data in JavaScript object notion (JSON). This study explores and analyzes our attempt to design and implement a structurally and logically compatible tethered personal health record (PHR) that allows bidirectional communication with an EHR.

This has led to a rapidly growing interest in standardizing computable representations of eligibility criteria (EC) in order to develop tools that leverage data from electronic health record (EHR) systems. Although laboratory procedures (LP) represent a common entity of EC that is readily available and retrievable from EHR systems, there is a lack of interoperable data models for this entity of EC. A public, specialized data model that utilizes international, widely-adopted terminology for LP, e.g. Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC(R)), is much needed to support automated screening tools. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to establish a core dataset for LP most frequently requested to recruit patients for clinical trials using LOINC terminology. Employing such a core dataset could enhance the interface between study feasibility platforms and EHR systems and significantly improve automatic patient recruitment. METHODS: We used a semi-automated approach to analyze 10,516 screening forms from the Medical Data Models (MDM) portal's data repository that are pre-annotated with Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). An automated semantic analysis based on concept frequency is followed by an extensive manual expert review performed by physicians to analyze complex recruitment-relevant concepts not amenable to automatic approach. RESULTS: Based on analysis of 138,225 EC from 10,516 screening forms, 55 laboratory procedures represented 77.87% of all UMLS laboratory concept occurrences identified in the selected EC forms. We identified 26,413 unique UMLS concepts from 118 UMLS semantic types and covered the vast majority of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) disease domains. CONCLUSIONS: Only a small set of common LP covers the majority of laboratory concepts in screening EC forms which supports the feasibility of establishing a focused core dataset for LP. We present ELaPro, a novel, LOINC-mapped, core dataset for the most frequent 55 LP requested in screening for clinical trials. ELaPro is available in multiple machine-readable data formats like CSV, ODM and HL7 FHIR. The extensive manual curation of this large number of free-text EC as well as the combining of UMLS and LOINC terminologies distinguishes this specialized dataset from previous relevant datasets in the literature.", 'CI': ['(c) 2022.

Pursuing digital feasibility queries on available patient data registries has proven to be an excellent way of reusing existing real-world data sources. To support multicentric research, these feasibility queries should be designed and implemented to run across multiple sites and securely access local data. Working across hospitals usually involves working with different data formats and vocabularies. Recently, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was developed by Health Level Seven to address this concern and describe patient data in a standardized format. The Medical Informatics Initiative in Germany has committed to this standard and created data integration centers, which convert existing data into the FHIR format at each hospital. This partially solves the interoperability problem; however, a distributed feasibility query platform for the FHIR standard is still missing. OBJECTIVE: This study described the design and implementation of the components involved in creating a cross-hospital feasibility query platform for researchers based on FHIR resources. This effort was part of a large COVID-19 data exchange platform and was designed to be scalable for a broad range of patient data. METHODS: We analyzed and designed the abstract components necessary for a distributed feasibility query. This included a user interface for creating the query, backend with an ontology and terminology service, middleware for query distribution, and FHIR feasibility query execution service. RESULTS: We implemented the components described in the Methods section. The resulting solution was distributed to 33 German university hospitals. The functionality of the comprehensive network infrastructure was demonstrated using a test data set based on the German Corona Consensus Data Set. A performance test using specifically created synthetic data revealed the applicability of our solution to data sets containing millions of FHIR resources. The solution can be easily deployed across hospitals and supports feasibility queries, combining multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria using standard Health Level Seven query languages such as Clinical Quality Language and FHIR Search. Developing a platform based on multiple microservices allowed us to create an extendable platform and support multiple Health Level Seven query languages and middleware components to allow integration with future directions of the Medical Informatics Initiative. CONCLUSIONS: We designed and implemented a feasibility platform for distributed feasibility queries, which works directly on FHIR-formatted data and distributed it across 33 university hospitals in Germany. We showed that developing a feasibility platform directly on the FHIR standard is feasible.', 'CI': ['(c)Julian Gruendner, Noemi Deppenwiese, Michael Folz, Thomas Kohler, Bjorn Kroll,', 'Hans-Ulrich Prokosch, Lorenz Rosenau, Mathias Ruhle, Marc-Anton Scheidl,', 'Christina Schuttler, Brita Sedlmayr, Alexander Twrdik, Alexander Kiel, Raphael W', 'Majeed.

To better understand the landscape of API use cases, we interviewed US thought leaders involved in developing and implementing standard-based APIs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted semi-structured virtual interviews with US subject matter experts (SMEs) on APIs. SMEs were asked to describe API use cases along with value and barriers for each use case. Written summaries were checked by the SME and analyzed by the study team to identify findings and themes. RESULTS: We interviewed 12 SMEs representing diverse sectors of the US healthcare system, including academia, industry, public health agencies, electronic health record vendors, government, and standards organizations. Use cases for standards-based APIs fell into six categories: patient-facing, clinician-facing, population health and value-based care, public health, administrative, and social services. The value across use cases was viewed as unrealized to date, and barriers to the use of APIs varied by use case. CONCLUSIONS: SMEs identified a diverse set of API use cases where standard-based APIs had the potential to generate value. As policy efforts seek to increase API adoption, our work provides an early look at the landscape of API use cases, value propositions, and barriers. Additional effort is needed to better understand the barriers and how to overcome them to create value, such as through demonstration projects and rigorous evaluations for specific use cases.', 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2022.

In the absence of newer antibiotics, the best possible approach is to efficiently use the existing antimicrobials through surveillance of resistance. The data generated by AMR surveillance across the country has immense potential to drive policy decisions. However, this data is available in a variety of sources. It is imperative to have tools to integrate the data generated across the country into a single data repository. METHODS: An ensemble of tools (i-AMRSS, i-DIA, and i-AMRIT) have been designed and developed by the data management team at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to strengthen surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in India. RESULTS: The i-AMRSS is a web-based ICMR's AMR surveillance system, collecting data from tertiary care centers across the country and sending it to the one-stop data repository. The i-DIA is a web-based API that simplifies the AMR data interoperability by seamlessly importing most of the LIS / HIS data from CSV files into a central, one-stop data repository. The i-AMRIT is a standalone ICMR's AMR surveillance system using integrative technologies, collecting data from all the labs across the country and sending the lab-specific cumulative data to the one-stop data repository. DISCUSSION: The tools are being used in ICMR's AMR Network and have collected over 0.4 million patient records to date.

However, given the complexity of the FHIR standard, the data harmonization is not sufficient to make the data accessible. A simplified visual representation is needed to reduce the technical burden, while allowing feasibility queries. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates how a search ontology can be automatically generated using FHIR profiles and a terminology server. Furthermore, it describes how this ontology can be used in a user interface (UI) and how a mapping and a terminology tree created together with the ontology can translate user input into FHIR queries. METHODS: We used the FHIR profiles from the GECCO data set combined with a terminology server to generate an ontology and the required mapping files for the translation. We analyzed the profiles and identified search criteria for the visual representation. In this process, we reduced the complex profiles to code value pairs for improved usability. We enriched our ontology with the necessary information to display it in a UI. We also developed an intermediate query language to transform the queries from the UI to federated FHIR requests. Separation of concerns resulted in discrepancies between the criteria used in the intermediate query format and the target query language. Therefore, a mapping was created to reintroduce all information relevant for creating the query in its target language. Further, we generated a tree representation of the ontology hierarchy, which allows resolving child concepts in the process. RESULTS: In the scope of this project, 82 (99%) of 83 elements defined in the GECCO profile were successfully implemented. We verified our solution based on an independently developed test patient. A discrepancy between the test data and the criteria was found in 6 cases due to different versions used to generate the test data and the UI profiles, the support for specific code systems, and the evaluation of postcoordinated Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes. Our results highlight the need for governance mechanisms for version changes, concept mapping between values from different code systems encoding the same concept, and support for different unit dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an automatic process to generate ontology and mapping files for FHIR-formatted data. Our tests found that this process works for most of our chosen FHIR profile criteria. The process established here works directly with FHIR profiles and a terminology server, making it extendable to other FHIR profiles and demonstrating that automatic ontology generation on FHIR profiles is feasible.", 'CI': ['(c)Lorenz Rosenau, Raphael W Majeed, Josef Ingenerf, Alexander Kiel, Bjorn Kroll,', 'Thomas Kohler, Hans-Ulrich Prokosch, Julian Gruendner.

As of June 2021, 5 emergency vaccines were available for COVID-19 prevention, and with the improvement of vaccination rates and the resumption of activities in each country, verification of vaccination has become an important issue. Currently, in most areas, vaccination and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results are certified and validated on paper. This leads to the problem of counterfeit documents. Therefore, a global vaccination record is needed. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study is to design a vaccine passport (VP) validation system based on a general blockchain architecture for international use in a simulated environment. With decentralized characteristics, the system is expected to have the advantages of low cost, high interoperability, effectiveness, security, and verifiability through blockchain architecture. METHODS: The blockchain decentralized mechanism was used to build an open and anticounterfeiting information platform for VPs. The contents of a vaccination card are recorded according to international Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standards, and blockchain smart contracts (SCs) are used for authorization and authentication to achieve hierarchical management of various international hospitals and people receiving injections. The blockchain stores an encrypted vaccination path managed by the user who manages the private key. The blockchain uses the proof-of-authority (PoA) public chain and can access all information through the specified chain. This will achieve the goal of keeping development costs low and streamlining vaccine transit management so that countries in different economies can use them. RESULTS: The openness of the blockchain helps to create transparency and data accuracy. This blockchain architecture contains a total of 3 entities. All approvals are published on Open Ledger. Smart certificates enable authorization and authentication, and encryption and decryption mechanisms guarantee data protection. This proof of concept demonstrates the design of blockchain architecture, which can achieve accurate global VP verification at an affordable price. In this study, an actual VP case was established and demonstrated. An open blockchain, an individually approved certification mechanism, and an international standard vaccination record were introduced. CONCLUSIONS: Blockchain architecture can be used to build a viable international VP authentication process with the advantages of low cost, high interoperability, effectiveness, security, and verifiability.', 'CI': ['(c)Hsiu An Lee, Wei-Chen Wu, Hsin-Hua Kung, Jai Ganesh Udayasankaran, Yu-Chih Wei,', 'Boonchai Kijsanayotin, Alvin B Marcelo, Chien-Yeh Hsu.

This is due in part to limited coordination among CDS components. To improve coordination of CDS components, Health Level 7 (HL7) has developed a suite of interoperability standards with Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification as a common information model. Evidence is needed to determine the feasibility of implementing these CDS components; therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the coordination of emerging HL7 standards with modular CDS architecture components. METHODS: We used a modular, standards-based architecture consisting of four components: data, logic, services, and applications. The implementation use-case was an application to support shared decision making in the context of drug-drug interactions (DDInteract). RESULTS: DDInteract uses FHIR as the data representation model, Clinical Quality Language for logic representation, CDS Hooks for the services layer, and Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies for application integration. DDInteract was first implemented in a sandbox environment and then in an electronic health record (Epic(R)) test environment. DDInteract can be integrated in clinical workflows through on-demand access from a menu or through CDS Hooks upon opening a patient's record or placing a medication order. CONCLUSION: In the context of drug interactions, DDInteract is the first application to leverage a full stack of emerging interoperability standards for each component of modular CDS architecture. The demonstrated feasibility of interoperable components can be generalized to other modular CDS applications.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Timely, accurate and complete death reporting is critical for public health, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, as institutions and government agencies rely on death reports to formulate responses to communicable diseases. Unfortunately, determining the causes of death is challenging even for experienced physicians. The novel coronavirus and its variants may further complicate the task, as physicians and experts are still investigating COVID-related complications. To assist physicians in accurately reporting causes of death, an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach is presented to determine a chronically ordered sequence of conditions that lead to death (named as the causal sequence of death), based on decedent's last hospital discharge record. The key design is to learn the causal relationship among clinical codes and to identify death-related conditions. There exist three challenges: different clinical coding systems, medical domain knowledge constraint, and data interoperability. First, we apply neural machine translation models with various attention mechanisms to generate sequences of causes of death. We use the BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score with three accuracy metrics to evaluate the quality of generated sequences. Second, we incorporate expert-verified medical domain knowledge as constraints when generating the causal sequences of death. Lastly, we develop a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) interface that demonstrates the usability of this work in clinical practice.

While only one advocate had sufficient EHR data to calculate risk using the BCSC model only, we identified variables including age, race/ethnicity, mammographic density, and prior breast biopsy in most advocates. EHR data from FHIR could be incorporated into automated breast cancer risk calculation in clinical decision support tools.', 'CI': ['(c)2021 AMIA - All rights reserved.'], 'FAU': ['McGuinness, Julia E', 'Zhang, Tianmai M', 'Cooper, Kevin', 'Kelkar, Arusha', 'Dimond, Jill', 'Lorenzi, Virginia', 'Crew, Katherine D', 'Kukafka, Rita'], 'AU': ['McGuinness JE', 'Zhang TM', 'Cooper K', 'Kelkar A', 'Dimond J', 'Lorenzi V', 'Crew KD', 'Kukafka R'], 'AD': ['Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Sassafras Tech Collective, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'GR': ['R01 CA177995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA226060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural'], 'DEP': '20220221', 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'AMIA Annu Symp Proc', 'JT': 'AMIA ...

A critical component for any PHM program is a data analytics platform that can target those eligible individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to design and implement a scalable standards-based clinical decision support (CDS) approach to identify patient cohorts for PHM and maximize opportunities for multi-site dissemination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An architecture was established to support bidirectional data exchanges between heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data sources, PHM systems, and CDS components. HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources and CDS Hooks were used to facilitate interoperability and dissemination. The approach was validated by deploying the platform at multiple sites to identify patients who meet the criteria for genetic evaluation of familial cancer. RESULTS: The Genetic Cancer Risk Detector (GARDE) platform was created and is comprised of four components: (1) an open-source CDS Hooks server for computing patient eligibility for PHM cohorts, (2) an open-source Population Coordinator that processes GARDE requests and communicates results to a PHM system, (3) an EHR Patient Data Repository, and (4) EHR PHM Tools to manage patients and perform outreach functions. Site-specific deployments were performed on onsite virtual machines and cloud-based Amazon Web Services. DISCUSSION: GARDE's component architecture establishes generalizable standards-based methods for computing PHM cohorts. Replicating deployments using one of the established deployment methods requires minimal local customization. Most of the deployment effort was related to obtaining site-specific information technology governance approvals.", 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2022.

To leverage RWD and generate reliable RWE, data should be well defined and structured in a way that is semantically interoperable and consistent across stakeholders. The adoption of data standards is one of the cornerstones supporting high-quality evidence for the development of clinical medicine and therapeutics. Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) data standards are mature, globally recognized, and heavily used by the pharmaceutical industry for regulatory submissions. The CDISC RWD Connect Initiative aims to better understand the barriers to implementing CDISC standards for RWD and to identify the tools and guidance needed to more easily implement them. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to understand the barriers to implementing CDISC standards for RWD and to identify the tools and guidance that may be needed to implement CDISC standards more easily for this purpose. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative Delphi survey involving an expert advisory board with multiple key stakeholders, with 3 rounds of input and review. RESULTS: Overall, 66 experts participated in round 1, 56 in round 2, and 49 in round 3 of the Delphi survey. Their inputs were collected and analyzed, culminating in group statements. It was widely agreed that the standardization of RWD is highly necessary, and the primary focus should be on its ability to improve data sharing and the quality of RWE. The priorities for RWD standardization included electronic health records, such as data shared using Health Level 7 Fast Health care Interoperability Resources (FHIR), and the data stemming from observational studies. With different standardization efforts already underway in these areas, a gap analysis should be performed to identify the areas where synergies and efficiencies are possible and then collaborate with stakeholders to create or extend existing mappings between CDISC and other standards, controlled terminologies, and models to represent data originating across different sources. CONCLUSIONS: There are many ongoing data standardization efforts around human health data-related activities, each with different definitions, levels of granularity, and purpose. Among these, CDISC has been successful in standardizing clinical trial-based data for regulation worldwide. However, the complexity of the CDISC standards and the fact that they were developed for different purposes, combined with the lack of awareness and incentives to use a new standard and insufficient training and implementation support, are significant barriers to setting up the use of CDISC standards for RWD. The collection and dissemination of use cases, development of tools and support systems for the RWD community, and collaboration with other standards development organizations are potential steps forward. Using CDISC will help link clinical trial data and RWD and promote innovation in health data science.', 'CI': ['(c)Rhonda Facile, Erin Elizabeth Muhlbradt, Mengchun Gong, Qingna Li, Vaishali', 'Popat, Frank Petavy, Ronald Cornet, Yaoping Ruan, Daisuke Koide, Toshiki I Saito,', 'Sam Hume, Frank Rockhold, Wenjun Bao, Sue Dubman, Barbara Jauregui Wurst.', 'Originally published in JMIR Medical Informatics (https://medinform.jmir.org),', '27.01.2022.'], 'FAU': ['Facile, Rhonda', 'Muhlbradt, Erin Elizabeth', 'Gong, Mengchun', 'Li, Qingna', 'Popat, Vaishali', 'Petavy, Frank', 'Cornet, Ronald', 'Ruan, Yaoping', 'Koide, Daisuke', 'Saito, Toshiki I', 'Hume, Sam', 'Rockhold, Frank', 'Bao, Wenjun', 'Dubman, Sue', 'Jauregui Wurst, Barbara'], 'AU': ['Facile R', 'Muhlbradt EE', 'Gong M', 'Li Q', 'Popat V', 'Petavy F', 'Cornet R', 'Ruan Y', 'Koide D', 'Saito TI', 'Hume S', 'Rockhold F', 'Bao W', 'Dubman S', 'Jauregui Wurst B'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-6388-1795', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6823-5864', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8197-6643', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9604-4168', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3961-6817', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3668-9922', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1704-5980', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3929-4195', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4238-0334', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5143-9185', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6045-7251', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3732-4765', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8448-1689', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7192-7992', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0108-3261'], 'AD': ['Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Medical Science and Computing, a Guidehouse company, Rockville, MD, United States.', 'Digital Health China Technologies, Bejing, China.', 'Institute of Health Management, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiyuan Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Clinical Research and Evaluation of Traditional Chinese Medicine of National Medical Products Administration, Beijing, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Chinese Medicine Cardiology, Beijing, China.', 'Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation Research, Silver Spring, MD, United States.', 'European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Informatics, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Amsterdam University Medical Centers - University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'LinkDoc Technologies, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.', 'JMP Life Sciences, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, United States.', 'Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, Austin, TX, United States.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20220127', 'PL': 'Canada', 'TA': 'JMIR Med Inform', 'JT': 'JMIR medical informatics', 'JID': '101645109', 'PMC': 'PMC8832264', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Delphi survey', 'FAIR principles', 'academic research', 'clinical data standards', 'clinical trials', 'data integration', 'electronic health records', 'observational data', 'public health data', 'real-world data', 'real-world evidence', 'registry data', 'regulatory submission'], 'COIS': ['Conflicts of Interest: FR is the chairman of the Board Frontier Science and', 'Technology Research Foundation and employee of Duke University and Duke Clinical', 'Research Institute.'], 'EDAT': '2022/01/28 06:00', 'MHDA': '2022/01/28 06:01', 'PMCR': ['2022/01/27'], 'CRDT': ['2022/01/27 12:14'], 'PHST': ['2021/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/27 12:14 [entrez]', '2022/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/28 06:01 [medline]', '2022/01/27 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['v10i1e30363 [pii]', '10.2196/30363 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'JMIR Med Inform. 2022 Jan 27;10(1):e30363. doi: 10.2196/30363.'}

However, metadata are often incomplete, and there is no standardized format for recording metadata, leading to inefficiency during the metadata-based data retrieval process. Here, we propose a novel standardization method for DICOM metadata termed the Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: R-CDM was designed to be compatible with Health Level Seven International (HL7)/Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and linked with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM to achieve a seamless link between clinical data and medical imaging data. The terminology system was standardized using the RadLex playbook, a comprehensive lexicon of radiology. As a proof of concept, the R-CDM conversion process was conducted with 41.7 TB of data from the Ajou University Hospital. The R-CDM database visualizer was developed to visualize the main characteristics of the R-CDM database. RESULTS: Information from 2801360 cases and 87203226 DICOM files was organized into two tables constituting the R-CDM. Information on imaging device and image resolution was recorded with more than 99.9% accuracy. Furthermore, OMOP-CDM and R-CDM were linked to efficiently extract specific types of images from specific patient cohorts. CONCLUSION: R-CDM standardizes the structure and terminology for recording medical imaging data to eliminate incomplete and unstandardized information. Successful standardization was achieved by the extract, transform, and load process and image classifier. We hope that the R-CDM will contribute to deep learning research in the medical imaging field by enabling the securement of large-scale medical imaging data from multinational institutions.', 'CI': ['(c) Copyright: Yonsei University College of Medicine 2022.'], 'FAU': ['Park, ChulHyoung', 'You, Seng Chan', 'Jeon, Hokyun', 'Jeong, Chang Won', 'Choi, Jin Wook', 'Park, Rae Woong'], 'AU': ['Park C', 'You SC', 'Jeon H', 'Jeong CW', 'Choi JW', 'Park RW'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0003-0531-9144', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5052-6399', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6220-4207', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9305-4686', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2396-4705', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4989-3287'], 'AD': ['Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.', 'Medical Convergence Research Center, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Korea.', 'Department of Radiology, Ajou University Medical Center, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ajou University Graduate School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea. veritas@ajou.ac.kr.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'GR': ['20003883/Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy/Korea', '20005021/Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy/Korea', '20001234/Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy/Korea', 'HR16C0001/Korea Health Industry Development Institute/Republic of Korea'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'PL': 'Korea (South)', 'TA': 'Yonsei Med J', 'JT': 'Yonsei medical journal', 'JID': '0414003', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Databases, Factual', '*Diagnostic Imaging', 'Humans', 'Radiography', '*Radiology', 'Reference Standards'], 'PMC': 'PMC8790584', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Metadata', 'radiology information system', 'standardization'], 'COIS': ['The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.'], 'EDAT': '2022/01/19 06:00', 'MHDA': '2022/01/20 06:00', 'PMCR': ['2022/01/01'], 'CRDT': ['2022/01/18 08:57'], 'PHST': ['2021/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/18 08:57 [entrez]', '2022/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/20 06:00 [medline]', '2022/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['63.S74 [pii]', '10.3349/ymj.2022.63.S74 [doi]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Yonsei Med J. 2022 Jan;63(Suppl):S74-S83. doi: 10.3349/ymj.2022.63.S74.'}

OBJECTIVE: This study outlines how we used mobile apps and semantic web standards such as HTTP 2.0, Representational State Transfer, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), JSON Schema, Transport Layer Security (version 1.3), Advanced Encryption Standard-256, OpenAPI, HTML5, and Vega, in conjunction with patient and provider feedback to completely update a previous version of mindLAMP. METHODS: The Learn, Assess, Manage, and Prevent (LAMP) platform addresses the abovementioned challenges in enhancing clinical insight by supporting research, data analysis, and implementation efforts around PGHD as an open-source solution with freely accessible and shared code. RESULTS: With a simplified programming interface and novel data representation that captures additional metadata, the LAMP platform enables interoperability with existing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources-based health care systems as well as consumer wearables and services such as Apple HealthKit and Google Fit.

A large volume of research findings from observational studies about disease interactions with COVID-19 is being produced almost daily, making it difficult for physicians to keep track of the latest information on COVID-19's effect on patients with certain pre-existing conditions. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe the creation of a clinical decision support tool, the SMART COVID Navigator, a web application to assist clinicians in treating patients with COVID-19. Our application allows clinicians to access a patient's electronic health records and identify disease interactions from a large set of observational research studies that affect the severity and fatality due to COVID-19. METHODS: The SMART COVID Navigator takes a 2-pronged approach to clinical decision support. The first part is a connection to electronic health record servers, allowing the application to access a patient's medical conditions. The second is accessing data sets with information from various observational studies to determine the latest research findings about COVID-19 outcomes for patients with certain medical conditions. By connecting these 2 data sources, users can see how a patient's medical history will affect their COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: The SMART COVID Navigator aggregates patient health information from multiple Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources-enabled electronic health record systems. This allows physicians to see a comprehensive view of patient health records. The application accesses 2 data sets of over 1100 research studies to provide information on the fatality and severity of COVID-19 for several pre-existing conditions. We also analyzed the results of the collected studies to determine which medical conditions result in an increased chance of severity and fatality of COVID-19 progression. We found that certain conditions result in a higher likelihood of severity and fatality probabilities.

We translated these definitions into the Clinical Quality Language (CQL) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and validated them using code review and automated tests. RESULTS: A total of 33 phenotype definitions met our inclusion criteria. We developed 40 CQL libraries, 231 value sets, and 347 test cases. To support these test cases, a total of 1624 FHIR resources were created as test data.

Among 86 items to map, total mapping coverage was 94%: 50 (58%) of the items were available as standard resources in FHIR and 31 (36%) could be mapped using extensions. Five items (6%) could not be mapped to FHIR. Analyzing each MDS resource type, there was a total mapping coverage of 93% for studies and 95% for questionnaires and documents, with 61% of the MDS items available as standard resources in FHIR for studies, 57% for questionnaires and 52% for documents. Extensions in studies, questionnaires and documents were used in 32%, 38% and 43% of items, respectively. This work shows that FHIR can be used as a standardized format in registries for clinical, epidemiological and public health research. However, further adjustments to the initial MDS are recommended - and two additional items even needed when implementing FHIR. Developing a MDS based on the FHIR standard could be a future approach to reduce data ambiguity and foster interoperability.', 'FAU': ['Klopfenstein, Sophie Anne Ines', 'Vorisek, Carina Nina', 'Shutsko, Aliaksandra', 'Lehne, Moritz', 'Sass, Julian', 'Lobe, Matthias', 'Schmidt, Carsten Oliver', 'Thun, Sylvia'], 'AU': ['Klopfenstein SAI', 'Vorisek CN', 'Shutsko A', 'Lehne M', 'Sass J', 'Lobe M', 'Schmidt CO', 'Thun S'], 'AD': ['Core Facility Digital Medicine and Interoperability, Berlin Institute of Health at Charite -Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.', 'Core Facility Digital Medicine and Interoperability, Berlin Institute of Health at Charite -Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.', 'ZB MED - Information Centre for Life Sciences, Germany.', 'Core Facility Digital Medicine and Interoperability, Berlin Institute of Health at Charite -Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.', 'Core Facility Digital Medicine and Interoperability, Berlin Institute of Health at Charite -Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics (IMISE), University of Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Community Medicine, University Medicine Greifswald, Germany.', 'Core Facility Digital Medicine and Interoperability, Berlin Institute of Health at Charite -Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'PL': 'Netherlands', 'TA': 'Stud Health Technol Inform', 'JT': 'Studies in health technology and informatics', 'JID': '9214582', 'MH': ['*COVID-19', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Health Level Seven', 'Humans', '*Metadata', 'Registries', 'SARS-CoV-2'], 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['COVID-19', 'FAIR data', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'HL7 FHIR', 'Infrastructure', 'Metadata Standards', 'Syntactic Interoperability'], 'EDAT': '2021/11/20 06:00', 'MHDA': '2021/11/23 06:00', 'CRDT': ['2021/11/19 06:04'], 'PHST': ['2021/11/19 06:04 [entrez]', '2021/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [medline]'], 'AID': ['SHTI210817 [pii]', '10.3233/SHTI210817 [doi]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Stud Health Technol Inform. 2021 Nov 18;287:73-77. doi: 10.3233/SHTI210817.'}

There is an urgent need to increase research on this area, and the secondary use of healthcare data has the potential to provide valuable insights on survivors' health trajectories. However, cancer survivors' data is often stored in silos and collected inconsistently. In this study we present CASIDE, an interoperable data model for cancer survivorship information that aims to accelerate the secondary use of healthcare data and data sharing across institutions. It is designed to provide a holistic view of the cancer survivor, taking into account not just the clinical data but also the patient's own perspective, and is built upon the emerging Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Advantages of adopting FHIR and challenges in information modelling using this standard are discussed. CASIDE is a generalizable approach that is already being used as a support tool for the development of downstream applications to support clinical decision making and can contribute to translational collaborative research on cancer survivorship.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

The ASH Research Collaborative houses 2 major initiatives: (1) the Data Hub and (2) the Clinical Trials Network (CTN). The Data Hub is a program for hematologic diseases in which networks of clinical care delivery sites are developed in specific disease areas, with individual patient data contributed through electronic health record (EHR) integration, direct data entry through electronic data capture, and external data sources. Disease-specific data models are constructed so that data can be assembled into analytic datasets and used to enhance clinical care through dashboards and other mechanisms. Initial models have been built in multiple myeloma (MM) and sickle cell disease (SCD) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards. The Data Hub also provides a framework for development of disease-specific learning communities (LC) and testing of health care delivery strategies. The ASH Research Collaborative SCD CTN is a clinical trials accelerator that creates efficiencies in the execution of multicenter clinical trials and has been initially developed for SCD.

One of the promising standards that aims to address this limitation is Health Level Seven International (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Clinical Genomics Implementation Guide-Release 1 (FHIR CG IG STU1). This study aims to identify various data content of some genetic lab test reports and map them to FHIR CG IG specification to assess its coverage and to provide some suggestions for standard development and implementation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed sample reports of 4 genetic tests and relevant professional reporting guidelines to identify their key data elements (KDEs) that were then mapped to FHIR CG IG. RESULTS: We identified 36 common KDEs among the analyzed genetic test reports, in addition to other unique KDEs for each genetic test. Relevant suggestions were made to guide the standard implementation and development. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The FHIR CG IG covers the majority of the identified KDEs. However, we suggested some FHIR extensions that might better represent some KDEs. These extensions may be relevant to FHIR implementations or future FHIR updates.The FHIR CG IG is an excellent step toward the interoperability of genetic lab test reports.

For this, we calculated the mapping score for different data categories and the relative data coverage in both FHIR and OMOP CDM. Our results show, that the patients genomic data can be mapped to OMOP CDM directly from VCF (Variant Call Format) file with a coverage of slightly over 50%. However, using FHIR as intermediate representation does not lead to further information loss as the already stored data in FHIR can be further transformed into OMOP CDM format with almost 100% success.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to propose a scalable architecture that allows the integration of information from different EHR systems. METHODS: A cloud-based EHR interoperable architecture is proposed through the standardization and integration of patient electronic health records. The data is stored in a cloud repository with high availability features. Stakeholders can retrieve the patient EHR by requesting only to the integrated data repository. The OpenEHR two-level approach is applied according to the HL7-FHIR standards. We validated our architecture by comparing it with 5 different works (CHISTAR, ARIEN, DIRAYA, LLPHR and INEHRIS) using a set of selected axes and a scoring method. RESULTS: The problem was reduced to a single point of communication between each EHR system and the integrated data repository. By combining cloud computing paradigm with selected health informatics standards, we obtained a generic and scalable architecture that complies 100% with interoperability requisites according to the evaluation framework applied. CONCLUSIONS: The architecture allowed the integration of several EHR systems, adapting them with the use of standards and ensuring the availability thanks to cloud computing features.', 'FAU': ['Gomez, Derlis', 'Romero, Jesus', 'Lopez, Pablo', 'Vazquez, Jose', 'Cappo, Cristian', 'Pinto, Diego', 'Villalba, Cynthia'], 'AU': ['Gomez D', 'Romero J', 'Lopez P', 'Vazquez J', 'Cappo C', 'Pinto D', 'Villalba C'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'Technol Health Care', 'JT': 'Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine', 'JID': '9314590', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Software'], 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Cloud EHR', 'Electronic health records', 'HL7 FHIR', 'OpenEHR', 'health informatics standards', 'interoperability'], 'EDAT': '2021/09/14 06:00', 'MHDA': '2022/06/03 06:00', 'CRDT': ['2021/09/13 06:29'], 'PHST': ['2021/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/13 06:29 [entrez]'], 'AID': ['THC212806 [pii]', '10.3233/THC-212806 [doi]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Technol Health Care. 2022;30(3):551-564. doi: 10.3233/THC-212806.'}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a program that gathered data from the public app galleries hosted by Allscripts, athenahealth, Cerner Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, and SMART. Data collection for this study began in December 2019 and ended December 2020. The program was run 11 times during this period, and the data collected were used to generate the findings and trends observed in this study. RESULTS: The total number of unique apps increased from 600 to 734 during the study period. The most common types of apps marketed were intended for administrative (42%) and clinical use (38%). About 1 in 5 apps (22%) described support for the FHIR standard. Support for FHIR varied by intended functionality and gallery. DISCUSSION: This study provides early insights into the number of third-party apps that are connecting to EHRs, what services they provide, and if these connections use standards-based application programming interfaces (APIs).

METHODS: We conducted a review of original studies describing development of specific CDS tools or infrastructures using one of the four targeted standards, regardless of implementation stage. Citations published any time before the literature search was executed on October 21, 2020 were retrieved from PubMed. Two reviewers independently screened articles and abstracted data according to a protocol designed by team consensus. RESULTS: Of 290 articles identified via PubMed search, 44 were included in this study. More than three quarters were published since 2018. Forty-three (98%) used FHIR; 22 (50%) used SMART; two (5%) used CQL; and eight (18%) used CDS Hooks. Twenty-four (55%) were in the design stage, 15 (34%) in the piloting stage, and five (11%) were deployed in a real-world setting. Only 12 (27%) of the articles reported an evaluation of the technology under development. Three of the four articles describing a deployed technology reported an evaluation. Only two evaluations with randomized study components were identified. CONCLUSION: The diversity of topics and approaches identified in the literature highlights the utility of these standards. The infrequency of reported evaluations, as well as the high number of studies in the design or piloting stage, indicate that these technologies are still early in their life cycles.

This can lead to divergence in electronic implementations, reducing the usefulness of collected data outside of that implementation setting. This work set out to evolve guidelines-based data dictionaries by mapping to HL7 Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and semantic terminology, thus progressing toward machine-readable guidelines that define the minimum data set required to support family planning and sexually transmitted infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data dictionaries were first structured to facilitate mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies, including ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, LOINC, and RxNorm. FHIR resources and codes were assigned to data dictionary terms. The data dictionary and mappings were used as inputs for a newly developed tool to generate FHIR implementation guides. RESULTS: Implementation guides for core data requirements for family planning and sexually transmitted infections were created. These implementation guides display data dictionary content as FHIR resources and semantic terminology codes. Challenges included the use of a two-dimensional spreadsheet to facilitate mapping, the need to create FHIR profiles and resource extensions, and applying FHIR to a data dictionary that was created with a user interface in mind. CONCLUSIONS: Authoring FHIR implementation guides is a complex and evolving practice, and there are limited examples for this groundbreaking work. Moving toward machine-readable guidelines by mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies requires a thorough understanding of the context and use of terminology, an applied information model, and other strategies for optimizing the creation and long-term management of implementation guides. Next steps for this work include validation and, eventually, real-world application. The process for creating the data dictionary and for generating implementation guides should also be improved to prepare for this expanding work.

Standardization of medical narratives is an important task for data exchange, integration, and semantic interoperability. OBJECTIVES: The article aims to develop the end-to-end pipeline for structuring Russian free-text allergy anamnesis using international standards. METHODS: The pipeline for free-text data standardization is based on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) and SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) to ensure semantic interoperability. The pipeline solves common tasks such as data preprocessing, classification, categorization, entities extraction, and semantic codes assignment. Machine learning methods, rule-based, and dictionary-based approaches were used to compose the pipeline. The pipeline was evaluated on 166 randomly chosen medical records. RESULTS: AllergyIntolerance resource was used to represent allergy anamnesis. The module for data preprocessing included the dictionary with over 90,000 words, including specific medication terms, and more than 20 regular expressions for errors correction, classification, and categorization modules resulted in four dictionaries with allergy terms (total 2,675 terms), which were mapped to SNOMED CT concepts. F-scores for different steps are: 0.945 for filtering, 0.90 to 0.96 for allergy categorization, 0.90 and 0.93 for allergens reactions extraction, respectively. The allergy terminology coverage is more than 95%. CONCLUSION: The proposed pipeline is a step to ensure semantic interoperability of Russian free-text medical records and could be effective in standardization systems for further data exchange and integration.', 'CI': ['Thieme.

Six themes emerged from the stakeholder feedback: Alignment, Value, Development Process, Implementation and Reporting Processes; EHR certification process; and Communication, Education, and Outreach. CMS and its partners addressed over 100 recommendations to improve the eCQM development, implementation, and reporting experience by creating implementation strategies. This included the development of new tools, such as the Measure Collaboration (MC) Workspace and ongoing testing of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based standards for quality measurement. CMS is sharing this summary of the eCQM Strategy Project to reflect CMS' interest in stakeholder engagement and burden reduction, increase awareness of available resources, and encourage continued engagement throughout this digital transformation in quality reporting.", 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

There is a need to leverage advances made in the past to implement an architecture that facilitates the timely and complete public health reporting of relevant case-related information that has previously not easily been available to the public health community. Electronic laboratory reporting (ELR) is a reliable method for reporting cases to public health authorities but contains very limited data. In an earlier pilot study, we designed the Public Health Automated Case Event Reporting (PACER) platform, which leverages existing ELR infrastructure as the trigger for creating an electronic case report. PACER is a FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources)-based system that queries the electronic health record from where the laboratory test was requested to extract expanded additional information about a case. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the pilot implementation of a modified PACER system for electronic case reporting and describe how this FHIR-based, open-source, and interoperable system allows health systems to conduct public health reporting while maintaining the appropriate governance of the clinical data. METHODS: ELR to a simulated public health department was used as the trigger for a FHIR-based query. Predetermined queries were translated into Clinical Quality Language logics. Within the PACER environment, these Clinical Quality Language logical statements were managed and evaluated against the providers' FHIR servers. These predetermined logics were filtered, and only data relevant to that episode of the condition were extracted and sent to simulated public health agencies as an electronic case report. Design and testing were conducted at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, and the pilot was deployed at the Medical University of South Carolina. We evaluated this architecture by examining the completeness of additional information in the electronic case report, such as patient demographics, medications, symptoms, and diagnoses. This additional information is crucial for understanding disease epidemiology, but existing electronic case reporting and ELR architectures do not report them. Therefore, we used the completeness of these data fields as the metrics for enriching electronic case reports. RESULTS: During the 8-week study period, we identified 117 positive test results for chlamydia. PACER successfully created an electronic case report for all 117 patients. PACER extracted demographics, medications, symptoms, and diagnoses from 99.1% (116/117), 72.6% (85/117), 70.9% (83/117), and 65% (76/117) of the cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PACER deployed in conjunction with electronic laboratory reports can enhance public health case reporting with additional relevant data. The architecture is modular in design, thereby allowing it to be used for any reportable condition, including evolving outbreaks. PACER allows for the creation of an enhanced and more complete case report that contains relevant case information that helps us to better understand the epidemiology of a disease.", 'CI': ['(c)Ninad Mishra, Jon Duke, Saugat Karki, Myung Choi, Michael Riley, Andrey V', 'Ilatovskiy, Marla Gorges, Leslie Lenert.

HBP is a major predictor of adverse health events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and kidney disease. Multiple guidelines recommend interventions to lower blood pressure, but implementation requires patient-centered approaches, including patient-facing CDS tools. METHODS: We defined concept sets needed to measure adherence to 71 recommendations drawn from eight HBP guidelines. We measured data quality for these concepts for two cohorts (HBP screening and HBP diagnosed) from electronic health record (EHR) data, including four use cases (screening, nonpharmacologic interventions, pharmacologic interventions, and adverse events) for CDS. RESULTS: We identified 102,443 people with diagnosed and 58,990 with undiagnosed HBP. We found that 21/35 (60%) of required concept sets were unused or inaccurate, with only 259 (25.3%) of 1,101 codes used. Use cases showed high inclusion (0.9-11.2%), low exclusion (0-0.1%), and missing patient-specific context (up to 65.6%), leading to data in 2/4 use cases being insufficient for accurate alerting. DISCUSSION: Data quality from the EHR required to implement recommendations for HBP is highly inconsistent, reflecting a fragmented health care system and incomplete implementation of standard terminologies and workflows. Although imperfect, data were deemed adequate for two test use cases. CONCLUSION: Current data quality allows for further development of patient-facing FHIR HBP tools, but extensive validation and testing is required to assure precision and avoid unintended consequences.', 'CI': ['Thieme.

PHR services can not only ensure interoperability, security, privacy, and data quality, but also consider the user's perspective in their design. OBJECTIVE: Using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and national health care data sets, this study aimed to design and develop an app for providing worker-centered, interconnected PHR services. METHODS: This study considered the user's perspective, using the human-centered design (HCD) methodology, to develop a PHR app suitable for occupational health. We developed a prototype after analyzing quantitative and qualitative data collected from workers and a health care professional group, after which we performed a usability evaluation. We structured workers' PHR items based on the analyzed data, and ensured structural and semantic interoperability using FHIR, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT), and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). This study integrated workers' health information scattered across different Korean institutions through an interface method, and workers' PHRs were managed through a cloud server, using Azure API for FHIR. RESULTS: In total, 562 workers from industrial parks participated in the quantitative study. The preferred data items for PHR were medication, number of steps walked, diet, blood pressure, weight, and blood glucose. The preferred features were ability to access medical checkup results, health information content provision, consultation record inquiry, and teleconsultation. The worker-centered PHR app collected data on, among others, life logs, vital signs, and medical checkup results; offered health care services such as reservation and teleconsultation; and provided occupational safety and health information through material safety data sheet search and health questionnaires. The app reflected improvements in user convenience and app usability proposed by 19 participants (7 health care professionals and 12 end users) in the usability evaluation. The After-Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ) was evaluated with a mean score of 5.90 (SD 0.34) out of 7, and the System Usability Scale (SUS) was evaluated a mean score of 88.7 (SD 4.83) out of 100. CONCLUSIONS: The worker-centered PHR app integrates workers' health information from different institutions and provides a variety of health care services from linked institutions through workers' shared PHR. This app is expected to increase workers' autonomy over their health information and support medical personnel's decision making regarding workers' health in the workplace. Particularly, the app will provide solutions for current major PHR challenges, and its design, which considers the user's perspective, satisfies the prerequisites for its utilization in occupational health.", 'CI': ['(c)Hyun Sang Park, Kwang Il Kim, Ho-Young Chung, Sungmoon Jeong, Jae Young Soh,', 'Young Ho Hyun, Hwa Sun Kim.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a unifying mission and vision, established multidisciplinary governance, and formulated a strategic plan. Key elements of our strategy include establishing a world-class team; creating shared infrastructure to support individual innovations; developing and implementing innovations with high anticipated impact and a clear path to adoption; incorporating best practices such as the use of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and related interoperability standards; and maximizing synergies across research and operations and with partner organizations. RESULTS: University of Utah Health launched the ReImagine EHR initiative in 2016. Supportive infrastructure developed by the initiative include various FHIR-related tooling and a systematic evaluation framework. More than 10 EHR-integrated digital innovations have been implemented to support preventive care, shared decision-making, chronic disease management, and acute clinical care. Initial evaluations of these innovations have demonstrated positive impact on user satisfaction, provider efficiency, and compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Return on investment has included improvements in care; over $35 million in external grant funding; commercial opportunities; and increased ability to adapt to a changing healthcare landscape. DISCUSSION: Key lessons learned include the value of investing in digital innovation initiatives leveraging FHIR; the importance of supportive infrastructure for accelerating innovation; and the critical role of user-centered design, implementation science, and evaluation.

Patients can conveniently access their health records and seek consultation from providers through secure web portals. With increasing adoption and patient engagement, the volume of patient secure messages has risen substantially, which opens up new research and development opportunities for patient-centered care. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a data model for patient secure messages based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to identify and extract significant information. METHODS: We initiated the first draft of the data model by analyzing FHIR and manually reviewing 100 sentences randomly sampled from more than 2 million patient-generated secure messages obtained from the online patient portal at the Mayo Clinic Rochester between February 18, 2010, and December 31, 2017. We then annotated additional sets of 100 randomly selected sentences using the Multi-purpose Annotation Environment tool and updated the data model and annotation guideline iteratively until the interannotator agreement was satisfactory. We then created a larger corpus by annotating 1200 randomly selected sentences and calculated the frequency of the identified medical concepts in these sentences. Finally, we performed topic modeling analysis to learn the hidden topics of patient secure messages related to 3 highly mentioned microconcepts, namely, fatigue, prednisone, and patient visit, and to evaluate the proposed data model independently. RESULTS: The proposed data model has a 3-level hierarchical structure of health system concepts, including 3 macroconcepts, 28 mesoconcepts, and 85 microconcepts. Foundation and base macroconcepts comprise 33.99% (841/2474), clinical macroconcepts comprise 64.38% (1593/2474), and financial macroconcepts comprise 1.61% (40/2474) of the annotated corpus. The top 3 mesoconcepts among the 28 mesoconcepts are condition (505/2474, 20.41%), medication (424/2474, 17.13%), and practitioner (243/2474, 9.82%). Topic modeling identified hidden topics of patient secure messages related to fatigue, prednisone, and patient visit. A total of 89.2% (107/120) of the top-ranked topic keywords are actually the health concepts of the data model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data model and annotated corpus enable us to identify and understand important medical concepts in patient secure messages and prepare us for further natural language processing analysis of such free texts. The data model could be potentially used to automatically identify other types of patient narratives, such as those in various social media and patient forums. In the future, we plan to develop a machine learning and natural language processing solution to enable automatic triaging solutions to reduce the workload of clinicians and perform more granular content analysis to understand patients' needs and improve patient-centered care.", 'CI': ['(c)Amrita De, Ming Huang, Tinghao Feng, Xiaomeng Yue, Lixia Yao.

However, there remain challenges and issues to resolve in this domain owing to the lack of proper standards, the growth of new technologies (mobile devices, tablets, ubiquitous computing), and health care providers who are reluctant to share patient information. Therefore, a solid systematic literature review was performed to understand the use of this new technology in the health care sector. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic literature reviews that focus on Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based electronic health records (EHRs). In addition, FHIR is the latest standard, which is in an infancy stage of development. Therefore, this is a hot research topic with great potential for further research in this domain. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to explore and perform a systematic review of the literature related to FHIR, including the challenges, implementation, opportunities, and future FHIR applications. METHODS: In January 2020, we searched articles published from January 2012 to December 2019 via all major digital databases in the field of computer science and health care, including ACM, IEEE Explorer, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. We identified 8181 scientific articles published in this field, 80 of which met our inclusion criteria for further consideration. RESULTS: The selected 80 scientific articles were reviewed systematically, and we identified open questions, challenges, implementation models, used resources, beneficiary applications, data migration approaches, and goals of FHIR.

Increased adoption of Health Level Seven Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs) in recent years by EHR systems has increased the availability of patient data for external applications such as REDCap. OBJECTIVE: Describe the development of the REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) module that provides seamless data exchange between the REDCap research EDC and any EHR system with a FHIR API. CDIS enables end users to independently set up their data collection projects, map EHR data to fields, and adjudicate data transfer without project-by-project involvement from Health Information Technology staff. METHODS: We identified two use cases for EHR data transfer into REDCap. Clinical Data Pull (CDP) automatically pulls EHR data into user-defined REDCap fields and replaces the workflow of having to transcribe or copy and paste data from the EHR. Clinical Data Mart (CDM) collects all specified data for a patient over a given time period and replaces the process of importing EHR data for registries from research databases. With an iterative process, we designed our access control, authentication, variable selection, and mapping interfaces in such a way that end users could easily set up and use CDIS. RESULTS: Since its release, the REDCap CDIS has been used to pull over 19.5 million data points for 82 projects at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Software and documentation are available through the REDCap Consortium. CONCLUSIONS: The new REDCap Clinical Data and Interoperability Services (CDIS) module leverages the FHIR standard to enable real-time and direct data extraction from the EHR. Researchers can self-service the mapping and adjudication of EHR data into REDCap. The uptake of CDIS at VUMC and other REDCap consortium sites is improving the accuracy and efficiency of EHR data collection by reducing the need for manual transcription and flat file uploads.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We applied the newly created PRO standards from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to facilitate the collection and integration of standardized PRO data. A novel multitiered architecture was created to enable seamless integration of PRO data via Substitutable Medical Apps and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources apps and scaled to different EHR platforms in multiple ambulatory settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a standards-based approach to deploy 2 apps that source and surface PRO data in real-time for provider use within the EHR and which rely on PRO assessments from an external center to streamline app and EHR integration. RESULTS: The apps were developed to enable patients to answer validated assessments (eg, a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System including using a Computer Adaptive Test format). Both apps were developed to populate the EHR in real time using the Health Level Seven FHIR standard allowing providers to view patients' data during the clinical encounter. The process of implementing this architecture with 2 different apps across 18 ambulatory care sites and 3 different EHR platforms is described. CONCLUSION: Our approach and solution proved feasible, secure, and time- and resource-efficient. We offer actionable guidance for this technology to be scaled and adapted to promote adoption in diverse ambulatory care settings and across different EHRs.", 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

The Indiana Learning Health System Initiative (ILHSI) is a new multi-institutional, collaborative regional LHS initiative led by the Regenstrief Institute (RI) and developed in partnership with five additional organizations: two Indiana-based health systems, two schools at Indiana University, and our state-wide health information exchange. We report our experiences and lessons learned during the initial 2-year phase of developing and implementing the ILHSI. METHODS: The initial goals of the ILHSI were to instantiate the concept, establish partnerships, and perform LHS pilot projects to inform expansion. We established shared governance and technical capabilities, conducted a literature review-based and regional environmental scan, and convened key stakeholders to iteratively identify focus areas, and select and implement six initial joint projects. RESULTS: The ILHSI successfully collaborated with its partner organizations to establish a foundational governance structure, set goals and strategies, and prioritize projects and training activities. We developed and deployed strategies to effectively use health system and regional HIE infrastructure and minimize information silos, a frequent challenge for multi-organizational LHSs. Successful projects were diverse and included deploying a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Standards (FHIR)-based tool across emergency departments state-wide, analyzing free-text elements of cross-hospital surveys, and developing models to provide clinical decision support based on clinical and social determinants of health. We also experienced organizational challenges, including changes in key leadership personnel and varying levels of engagement with health system partners, which impacted initial ILHSI efforts and structures. Reflecting on these early experiences, we identified lessons learned and next steps. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-organizational LHSs can be challenging to develop but present the opportunity to leverage learning across multiple organizations and systems to benefit the general population. Attention to governance decisions, shared goal setting and monitoring, and careful selection of projects are important for early success.', 'CI': ['(c) 2021 The Authors.

When PHR connects with multiple electronic health records (EHRs), doctors and patients can exchange large quantities of patient data from the EHR (e.g., medication list, diagnoses, allergies, and laboratory data). Furthermore, personal daily records can also be retrieved from PHR (e.g., blood pressure, pulse, dietary habits, and exercise). However, no standard interoperability between EHRs and PHR has been established. This study aims to convert clinical data in EHRs into the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data format while developing a PHR application to present the FHIR data. METHODS: In Japan, Standardized Structured Medical Information eXchange version 2 (SS-MIX2) is typically utilized as a health information exchange to preserve and elicit clinical data from EHRs. We converted clinical data in the SS-MIX2 storage at Tohoku University Hospital into the FHIR repository server using the R4 standard. Additionally, we used the Swift programming language to build a PHR application. RESULTS: We converted patients' basic information, disease names, diagnostic reports, prescriptions, and injection data from the SS-MIX2 to the FHIR server. Besides, we launched a PHR application that could retrieve data from the FHIR server to display patients' clinical information. CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrated the conversion of SS-MIX2 data into the FHIR and presented them with our PHR application. This mechanism may be useful to accelerate the sharing of clinical information among doctors and patients.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated an innovative ICT platform for integrated care which orchestrates data from various health care providers to optimize care management processes. METHODS: The Horizon2020-funded research project PICASO (picaso-project.eu) established an ICT platform that offers integration of care services across providers and supports patients\' management along the continuum of care, leaving the data with the owner. Strict conformity with ethical and legal legislations was augmented with a usability-driven engineering process, user requirements gathering from relevant stakeholders, and expert walkthroughs guided developments. Developments based on the HL7/FHIR standard granting interoperability. Platform\'s applicability in clinical routine was an essential aim. Thus, we evaluated the platform according to an evaluation framework in an observational 6-month proof-of-concept study with RA patients affected by cardiovascular comorbidities using questionnaires, interviews, and platform data. RESULTS: Thirty RA patients (80% female) participated, mean age 59 years, disease duration 13 years, average number of comorbidities 2.9. Home monitoring data demonstrated high platform adherence. Evaluations yielded predominantly positive feedback: The innovative dashboard-like design offering time-efficient data visualization, comprehension, and personalization was well accepted, i.e., patients rated the platform "overall" as 2.3 (1.1) (mean (SD), Likert scales 1-6) and clinicians recommended further platform use for 93% of their patients. They managed 86% of patients\' visits using the clinician dashboard. Dashboards were valued for a broader view of health status and patient-physician interactions. Platform use contributed to improved disease and comorbidity management (i.e., in 70% physicians reported usefulness to assess patients\' diseases and in 33% potential influence on treatment decisions; risk manager was used in 59%) and empowered patients (i.e., 48% set themselves new health-related goals, 92% stated easier patient-physician communications). CONCLUSION: Comprehensive aggregation of clinical data from distributed sources in a modern, GDPR-compliant cloud platform can improve physicians\' and patients\' knowledge of the disease status and comorbidities as well as patients\' management. It empowers patients to monitor and positively contribute to their disease management. Effects on patients\' outcome, behavior, and changes in the health care systems should be explored by implementing ICT-based platforms enriched by upcoming Artificial Intelligence features where possible.

However, Apple currently does not provide an efficient solution for accessing and sharing ECG raw data in a standardized data format. Our method aims to provide a solution that enables patients to share their Apple Watch's ECG data with any health care institution via an iPhone application. We achieved this by implementing a parser in Swift that converts the Apple Watch's raw ECG data into a FHIR observation. Furthermore, we added the capability of transmitting these observations to a specified server and equipping it with the patient's reference number.

In this paper we will present an approach to gradually integrate quality of life (QoL) as a control element into the care delivery of oncology. CONCEPT: Acceptance, usability, interoperability and data protection were identified and integrated as key indicators for the development. As an initial approach, a questionnaire tool was developed to provide patients a simplified answering of questionnaires and physicians a clearer presentation of the results. IMPLEMENTATION: As communication standard HL7 FHIR was used and known security concepts like OpenID Concept were integrated. In a usability study, first results were achieved by asking patients in the waiting room to answer a questionnaire, which will be discussed with the physician in the appointment. This study was conducted in 2019 at theSLK Clinics Heilbronn and achieved 86% participation of all respondents with an average age of 67 years. DISCUSSION: Although the evaluation study could prove positive results in usability and acceptance, it is necessary to aim for longitudinal surveys in order to include QoL as a control element in the therapy. However, a longitudinal survey through questionnaires leads to decreasing compliance and increasing response bias. [2] For this reason, the concept needs to be expanded. With sensors a continuous monitoring can be carried out and the data can be mapped to the individual, interpreted by machine learning. CONCLUSION: Questionnaires are a concept that has been successfully applied in studies for years. However, since care delivery poses different challenges, the integration of new concepts is inevitable.

This paper explores and analyzes the exploitation of HL7 FHIR to design and implement an interoperable patient empowerment platform that can be seamlessly integrated with external chronic disease management and Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.', 'FAU': ['Erturkmen, Gokce Banu Laleci', 'Yuksel, Mustafa', 'Baskaya, Mert', 'Sarigul, Bunyamin', 'Teoman, Alper', 'Yilmaz, Gokhan', 'de Manuel, Esteban'], 'AU': ['Erturkmen GBL', 'Yuksel M', 'Baskaya M', 'Sarigul B', 'Teoman A', 'Yilmaz G', 'de Manuel E'], 'AD': ['SRDC Software Research Development & Consultancy Corp, Ankara, Turkey.', 'SRDC Software Research Development & Consultancy Corp, Ankara, Turkey.', 'SRDC Software Research Development & Consultancy Corp, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Informatics Institute, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'SRDC Software Research Development & Consultancy Corp, Ankara, Turkey.', 'SRDC Software Research Development & Consultancy Corp, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Kronikgune Institute for Health Services Research, Spain.'], 'CN': ['ADLIFE Consortium'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'PL': 'Netherlands', 'TA': 'Stud Health Technol Inform', 'JT': 'Studies in health technology and informatics', 'JID': '9214582', 'MH': ['Electronic Health Records', '*Health Level Seven', 'Humans', '*Patient Participation'], 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Chronic Disease Management', 'HL7 FHIR', 'Interoperability', 'Patient Empowerment'], 'EDAT': '2021/05/28 06:00', 'MHDA': '2021/06/01 06:00', 'CRDT': ['2021/05/27 12:28'], 'PHST': ['2021/05/27 12:28 [entrez]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]'], 'AID': ['SHTI210316 [pii]', '10.3233/SHTI210316 [doi]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Stud Health Technol Inform. 2021 May 27;281:936-941. doi: 10.3233/SHTI210316.'}

In Danish EHRs, access to patient data recorded in prehospital settings is either not available or accessible in a PDF file. The amount of patient and administrative data registered at the prehospital unit is high and includes a rich representation of the accident, the patient and treatment. By applying emphasis framing to the representation of data, information overload can be diminished. Several international studies have investigated the suboptimal reuse of data within this field. Hence, the aim of this pre-study was to develop webservices based on emphasis framing to increase interoperability between the prehospital health record and the emergency room's EHR. In this study, requirements engineering and emphasis framing was applied. Iterative linear requirement specification process was chosen as a frame to address the aim. The five included phases were revisited due to the iterative nature of this study. Tools used in the requirement engineering process were semi structured interviews and direct observations. The pre-study resulted in 12 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) profiles using SNOMED CT terminology bindings. The profiles contained elements which represented primarily patient data recorded in the prehospital setting. The profiles were compared to a case representing the urgent continuity of care to validate their ability to standardize data from prehospital health records. Conclusively, FHIR profiles can be modelled to standardize prehospital urgent patient data to support the patient trajectory.

The photographic documentation of such clinical specimens is essential, and it may be required in certain instances. Our department began using consumer-grade digital cameras in 2005 to improve the practice of gross photography. However, the lack of an application to correctly catalog the photographs resulted in thousands of digital image files scattered across shared network drives, with limited case and patient metadata, making image retrieval a cumbersome and sometimes impossible task. Thirteen years later, we examined the legacy method of acquiring and accessing gross photographs in our department and determined the need for a web-based digital media archive to capture images with structured metadata. Using several open-source tools, including MediaWiki, we developed a flexible platform for building our digital media archive with a data schema based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard. Following a short pilot, we replaced the legacy method of handling gross pathology images with a new acquisition workflow and digital media archive. Through March 2021, 233 distinct users have accessed the system, 58 of which have uploaded 21,024 images. Of those images, 13,684 (65.1%) correspond to surgical pathology images, 4045 (19.2%) belong to neuropathology cases, and 3295 (15.7%) originate from autopsies. We demonstrate the design and implementation of a customizable anatomic pathology digital media archive solution in an academic pathology department setting using a modern standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically.

A key research area focuses on the early detection of primary cancers and potential prediction of cancers of unknown primary in order to facilitate optimal treatment decisions. OBJECTIVE: This study presents a methodology to harmonize phenotypic and genetic data features to classify primary cancer types and predict cancers of unknown primaries. METHODS: We extracted genetic data elements from oncology genetic reports of 1011 patients with cancer and their corresponding phenotypical data from Mayo Clinic's electronic health records. We modeled both genetic and electronic health record data with HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. The semantic web Resource Description Framework was employed to generate the network-based data representation (ie, patient-phenotypic-genetic network). Based on the Resource Description Framework data graph, Node2vec graph-embedding algorithm was applied to generate features. Multiple machine learning and deep learning backbone models were compared for cancer prediction performance. RESULTS: With 6 machine learning tasks designed in the experiment, we demonstrated the proposed method achieved favorable results in classifying primary cancer types (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 96.56% for all 9 cancer predictions on average based on the cross-validation) and predicting unknown primaries (AUROC 80.77% for all 8 cancer predictions on average for real-patient validation). To demonstrate the interpretability, 17 phenotypic and genetic features that contributed the most to the prediction of each cancer were identified and validated based on a literature review.

To meet this need, several large new data consortia have been developed that require frequent updating and sharing of electronic health record (EHR) data in different common data models (CDMs) to create multi-institutional databases for research. Traditionally, each CDM has had a custom pipeline for extract, transform, and load operations for production and incremental updates of data feeds to the networks from raw EHR data. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely data are far higher, and the requirements for updating faster than previous collaborative research using national data networks have increased. New approaches need to be developed to address these demands. METHODS: In this article, we describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical data model and the automated transformation of clinical data to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs for data sharing and research collaboration on COVID-19. RESULTS: FHIR data resources could be transformed to operational PCORnet and OMOP CDMs with minimal production delays through a combination of real-time and postprocessing steps, leveraging the FHIR data subscription feature. CONCLUSIONS: The approach leverages evolving standards for the availability of EHR data developed to facilitate data exchange under the 21st Century Cures Act and could greatly enhance the availability of standardized datasets for research.', 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

However, there are still many challenges to achieving this vision. The goal of this project was to develop and apply methods for enhancing chronic disease care using AI. METHODS: Using a dataset of 27,904 patients with diabetes, an analytical method was developed and validated for generating a treatment pathway graph which consists of models that predict the likelihood of alternate treatment strategies achieving care goals. An AI-driven clinical decision support system (CDSS) integrated with the electronic health record (EHR) was developed by encapsulating the prediction models in an OpenCDS Web service module and delivering the model outputs through a SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) web-based dashboard. This CDSS enables clinicians and patients to review relevant patient parameters, select treatment goals, and review alternate treatment strategies based on prediction results. RESULTS: The proposed analytical method outperformed previous machine-learning algorithms on prediction accuracy. The CDSS was successfully integrated with the Epic EHR at the University of Utah. CONCLUSION: A predictive analytics-based CDSS was developed and successfully integrated with the EHR through standards-based interoperability frameworks. The approach used could potentially be applied to many other chronic conditions to bring AI-driven CDSS to the point of care.', 'CI': ['The Author(s).

Anecdotally, we know that EHR integration is a complex and time-consuming task; yet, the process has not been examined in detail. As part of an implementation project, we examined the work involved in integrating an encounter PDA for symptomatic uterine fibroids into Epic EHR systems. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the steps and time required to integrate a PDA into the Epic EHR system and examine facilitators and barriers to the integration effort. METHODS: We conducted a case study at 5 academic medical centers in the United States. A clinical champion at each institution liaised with their Epic EHR team to initiate the integration of the uterine fibroid Option Grid PDAs into clinician-facing menus. We scheduled regular meetings with the Epic software analysts and an expert Epic technologist to discuss how best to integrate the tools into Epic for use by clinicians with patients. The meetings were then recorded and transcribed. Two researchers independently coded the transcripts and field notes before categorizing the codes and conducting a thematic analysis to identify the facilitators and barriers to EHR integration. The steps were reviewed and edited by an Epic technologist to ensure their accuracy. RESULTS: Integrating the uterine fibroid Option Grid PDA into clinician-facing menus required an 18-month timeline and a 6-step process, as follows: task priority negotiation with Epic software teams, security risk assessment, technical review, Epic configuration; troubleshooting, and launch. The key facilitators of the process were the clinical champions who advocated for integration at the institutional level and the presence of an experienced technologist who guided Epic software analysts during the build. Another facilitator was the use of an emerging industry standard app platform (Health Level 7 Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) as a means of integrating the Option Grid into existing systems. This standard platform enabled clinicians to access the tools by using single sign-on credentials and prevented protected health information from leaving the EHR. Key barriers were the lack of control over the Option Grid product developed by EBSCO (Elton B Stephens Company) Health; the periodic Epic upgrades that can result in a pause on new software configurations; and the unforeseen software problems with Option Grid (ie, inability to print the PDA), which delayed the launch of the PDA. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of PDAs into the Epic EHR system requires a 6-step process and an 18-month timeline. The process required support and prioritization from a clinical champion, guidance from an experienced technologist, and a willing EHR software developer team.', 'CI': ['(c)Peter Scalia, Farhan Ahmad, Danielle Schubbe, Rachel Forcino, Marie-Anne Durand,', 'Paul James Barr, Glyn Elwyn.

By leveraging FHIR to shape not only the interface strategy but also the information architecture of the application, StayHome enables the consistent standards-based representation of data and reduces the barrier to integration with public health information systems. FHIR supported rapid application development by providing a domain-appropriate data model and tooling. FHIR modules and implementation guides were referenced in design and implementation. However, there are gaps in the FHIR specification which must be recognized and addressed appropriately.

As the number of requests for NGS genomic testing increases, substantial efforts have been made to deliver the testing results clearly and unambiguously. For the legitimacy of clinical NGS genomic testing, quality information from the process of producing genomic data should be included within the results. However, most reports provide insufficient quality information to confirm the reliability of genomic testing owing to the complexity of the NGS process. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based web app, NGS Quality Reporting (NGS-QR), to report and manage the quality of the information obtained from clinical NGS genomic tests. METHODS: We defined data elements for the exchange of quality information from clinical NGS genomic tests, and profiled a FHIR genomic resource to enable information exchange in a standardized format. We then developed the FHIR-based web app and FHIR server to exchange quality information, along with statistical analysis tools implemented with the R Shiny server. RESULTS: Approximately 1000 experimental data entries collected from the targeted sequencing pipeline CancerSCAN designed by Samsung Medical Center were used to validate implementation of the NGS-QR app using real-world data. The user can share the quality information of NGS genomic testing and verify the quality status of individual samples in the overall distribution. CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully demonstrated how quality information of clinical NGS genomic testing can be exchanged in a standardized format. As the demand for NGS genomic testing in clinical settings increases and genomic data accumulate, quality information can be used as reference material to improve the quality of testing. This app could also motivate laboratories to perform diagnostic tests to provide high-quality genomic data.', 'CI': ['(c)Donghyeong Seong, Sungwon Jung, Sungchul Bae, Jongsuk Chung, Dae-Soon Son,', 'Byoung-Kee Yi.

Patients provide information such as vital signs, well-being, and medication intake via smartphone apps. The information is transferred directly into a database and electronic health record at the kidney transplant center, which is used for routine patient care and research. Physicians can send an updated medication plan and laboratory data directly to the patient app via this secure platform. Other features of the app are medical messages and video consultations. Consequently, the patient is better-informed, and self-management is facilitated. In addition, the transplant center and the patient's local nephrologist automatically exchange notes, medical reports, laboratory values, and medication data via the platform. A telemedicine team reviews all incoming data on a dashboard and takes action, if necessary. Tools to identify patients at risk for complications are under development. The platform exchanges data via a standardized secure interface (Health Level 7 (HL7), Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)). The standardized data exchange based on HL7 FHIR guarantees interoperability with other eHealth solutions and allows rapid scalability to other chronic diseases. The underlying data protection concept is in concordance with the latest European General Data Protection Regulation. Enrollment started in February 2020, and 131 kidney transplant recipients are actively participating as of July 2020.

Current research data repositories typically require extensive efforts in harmonizing and transforming original clinical data. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format was designed primarily to represent clinical processes; therefore, it closely resembles the clinical data model and is more widely available across modern electronic health records. However, no common standardized data format is directly suitable for statistical analyses, and data need to be preprocessed before statistical analysis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate how FHIR data can be queried directly with a preprocessing service and be used for statistical analyses. METHODS: We propose that the binary JavaScript Object Notation format of the PostgreSQL (PSQL) open source database is suitable for not only storing FHIR data, but also extending it with preprocessing and filtering services, which directly transform data stored in FHIR format into prepared data subsets for statistical analysis. We specified an interface for this preprocessor, implemented and deployed it at University Hospital Erlangen-Nurnberg, generated 3 sample data sets, and analyzed the available data. RESULTS: We imported real-world patient data from 2016 to 2018 into a standard PSQL database, generating a dataset of approximately 35.5 million FHIR resources, including "Patient," "Encounter," "Condition" (diagnoses specified using International Classification of Diseases codes), "Procedure," and "Observation" (laboratory test results). We then integrated the developed preprocessing service with the PSQL database and the locally installed web-based KETOS analysis platform. Advanced statistical analyses were feasible using the developed framework using 3 clinically relevant scenarios (data-driven establishment of hemoglobin reference intervals, assessment of anemia prevalence in patients with cancer, and investigation of the adverse effects of drugs). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows how the standard open source database PSQL can be used to store FHIR data and be integrated with a specifically developed preprocessing and analysis framework. This enables dataset generation with advanced medical criteria and the integration of subsequent statistical analysis. The web-based preprocessing service can be deployed locally at the hospital level, protecting patients\' privacy while being integrated with existing open source data analysis tools currently being developed across Germany.', 'CI': ['(c)Julian Gruendner, Christian Gulden, Marvin Kampf, Sebastian Mate, Hans-Ulrich', 'Prokosch, Jakob Zierk.

The objective of the study is to develop and evaluate a Java based FHIR RDF data transformation toolkit to facilitate the use and validation of FHIR RDF data. We extended the popular HAPI FHIR tooling to add RDF support, thus enabling FHIR data in XML or JSON to be transformed to or from RDF. We also developed an RDF Shape Expression (ShEx)-based validation framework to verify conformance of FHIR RDF data to the ShEx schemas provided in the FHIR specification for FHIR versions R4 and R5. The effectiveness of ShEx validation was demonstrated by testing it against 2693 FHIR R4 examples and 2197 FHIR R5 examples that are included in the FHIR specification. A total of 5 types of errors including missing properties, unknown element, missing resource Type, invalid attribute value, and unknown resource name in the R5 examples were revealed, demonstrating the value of the ShEx in the quality assurance of the evolving R5 development.

To meet this need, several large clinical consortia have developed networks for access to RWD from electronic health records (EHR), each with its own common data model (CDM) and custom pipeline for extraction, transformation, and load operations for production and incremental updating. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely RWD (e.g., 2-week delay) make this less feasible. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical model for representation of clinical data for automated transformation to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs and the near automated production of linked clinical data repositories (CDRs) for COVID-19 research using the FHIR subscription standard. The approach was applied to healthcare data from a large academic institution and was evaluated using published quality assessment tools. RESULTS: Six years of data (1.07M patients, 10.1M encounters, 137M laboratory results), were loaded into the FHIR CDR producing 3 linked real-time linked repositories: FHIR, PCORnet, and OMOP. PCORnet and OMOP databases were refined in subsequent post processing steps into production releases and met published quality standards. The approach greatly reduced CDM production efforts.

Although there have been attempts at data sharing with the community, initiatives are still limited. In this context, a French task force composed of Integrated Cancer Research Sites (SIRICs), comprehensive cancer centers from the Unicancer network (one of Europe's largest cancer research organization), and university hospitals launched an initiative to improve and accelerate retrospective and prospective clinical and genomic data sharing in oncology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 5 years, the OSIRIS group has worked on structuring data and identifying technical solutions for collecting and sharing them. The group used a multidisciplinary approach that included weekly scientific and technical meetings over several months to foster a national consensus on a minimal data set. RESULTS: The resulting OSIRIS set and event-based data model, which is able to capture the disease course, was built with 67 clinical and 65 omics items. The group made it compatible with the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format to maximize interoperability. The OSIRIS set was reviewed, approved by a National Plan Strategic Committee, and freely released to the community. A proof-of-concept study was carried out to put the OSIRIS set and Common Data Model into practice using a cohort of 300 patients. CONCLUSION: Using a national and bottom-up approach, the OSIRIS group has defined a model including a minimal set of clinical and genomic data that can be used to accelerate data sharing produced in oncology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied an HCD process to develop a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application that displays a patient's asthma history to clinicians in a pediatric emergency department. We performed a preimplementation comparative system evaluation to measure time on task, number of screens, information retrieval accuracy, cognitive load, user satisfaction, and perceived utility and usefulness. Application usage and system functionality were assessed using application logs and a postimplementation survey of end users. RESULTS: Usability testing of the Asthma Timeline Application demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in time on task (P < .001), number of screens (P < .001), and cognitive load (P < .001) for clinicians when compared to base EHR functionality. Postimplementation evaluation demonstrated reliable functionality and high user satisfaction. DISCUSSION: Following HCD processes to develop an application in the context of clinical operations/quality improvement is feasible. Our work also highlights the potential benefits and challenges associated with using internationally recognized data exchange standards as currently implemented. CONCLUSION: Compared to standard EHR functionality, our visualization increased clinician efficiency when reviewing the charts of pediatric asthma patients.

A growing number of FHIR-based clinical genomics applications are emerging. Here, we describe an open source utility for converting variants from VCF format into HL7 FHIR format. RESULTS: vcf2fhir converts VCF variants into a FHIR Genomics Diagnostic Report. Conversion translates each VCF row into a corresponding FHIR-formatted variant in the generated report. In scope are simple variants (SNVs, MNVs, Indels), along with zygosity and phase relationships, for autosomes, sex chromosomes, and mitochondrial DNA. Input parameters include VCF file and genome build ('GRCh37' or 'GRCh38'); and optionally a conversion region that indicates the region(s) to convert, a studied region that lists genomic regions studied by the lab, and a non-callable region that lists studied regions deemed uncallable by the lab. Conversion can be limited to a subset of VCF by supplying genomic coordinates of the conversion region(s). If studied and non-callable regions are also supplied, the output FHIR report will include 'region-studied' observations that detail which portions of the conversion region were studied, and of those studied regions, which portions were deemed uncallable. We illustrate the vcf2fhir utility via two case studies. The first, 'SMART Cancer Navigator', is a web application that offers clinical decision support by linking patient EHR information to cancerous gene variants. The second, 'Precision Genomics Integration Platform', intersects a patient's FHIR-formatted clinical and genomic data with knowledge bases in order to provide on-demand delivery of contextually relevant genomic findings and recommendations to the EHR. CONCLUSIONS: Experience to date shows that the vcf2fhir utility can be effectively woven into clinically useful genomic-EHR integration pipelines. Additional testing will be a critical step towards the clinical validation of this utility, enabling it to be integrated in a variety of real world data flow scenarios. For now, we propose the use of this utility primarily to accelerate FHIR Genomics understanding and to facilitate experimentation with further integration of genomics data into the EHR.", 'FAU': ['Dolin, Robert H', 'Gothi, Shaileshbhai R', 'Boxwala, Aziz', 'Heale, Bret S E', 'Husami, Ammar', 'Jones, James', 'Khangar, Himanshu', 'Londhe, Shubham', 'Naeymi-Rad, Frank', 'Rao, Soujanya', 'Rapchak, Barbara', 'Shalaby, James', 'Suraj, Varun', 'Xie, Ning', 'Chamala, Srikar', 'Alterovitz, Gil'], 'AU': ['Dolin RH', 'Gothi SR', 'Boxwala A', 'Heale BSE', 'Husami A', 'Jones J', 'Khangar H', 'Londhe S', 'Naeymi-Rad F', 'Rao S', 'Rapchak B', 'Shalaby J', 'Suraj V', 'Xie N', 'Chamala S', 'Alterovitz G'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-6235-6964'], 'AD': ['Elimu Informatics, 1160 Brickyard Cove Rd Ste 200, Richmond, CA, 94801-4173, USA. bdolin@elimu.io.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Elimu Informatics, 1160 Brickyard Cove Rd Ste 200, Richmond, CA, 94801-4173, USA.', 'Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', "Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.", "Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.", 'Elimu Informatics, 1160 Brickyard Cove Rd Ste 200, Richmond, CA, 94801-4173, USA.', 'Elimu Informatics, 1160 Brickyard Cove Rd Ste 200, Richmond, CA, 94801-4173, USA.', 'Leap of Faith, Libertyville, IL, USA.', 'Elimu Informatics, 1160 Brickyard Cove Rd Ste 200, Richmond, CA, 94801-4173, USA.', 'Elimu Informatics, 1160 Brickyard Cove Rd Ste 200, Richmond, CA, 94801-4173, USA.', 'Elimu Informatics, 1160 Brickyard Cove Rd Ste 200, Richmond, CA, 94801-4173, USA.', 'Lexington High School, Lexington, MA, USA.', "Biomedical Cybernetics Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.", 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.", 'Harvard/MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20210302', 'PL': 'England', 'TA': 'BMC Bioinformatics', 'JT': 'BMC bioinformatics', 'JID': '100965194', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['*Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Electronic Health Records', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Knowledge Bases', 'Oncogenes'], 'PMC': 'PMC7923512', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Clinical genomics', 'EHR integration', 'FHIR', 'Next-generation sequencing', 'SMART-on-FHIR'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'], 'EDAT': '2021/03/04 06:00', 'MHDA': '2021/04/13 06:00', 'PMCR': ['2021/03/02'], 'CRDT': ['2021/03/03 05:33'], 'PHST': ['2020/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/03 05:33 [entrez]', '2021/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/03/02 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['10.1186/s12859-021-04039-1 [pii]', '4039 [pii]', '10.1186/s12859-021-04039-1 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'BMC Bioinformatics. 2021 Mar 2;22(1):104. doi: 10.1186/s12859-021-04039-1.'}

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR(R)) standard which is overcoming the interoperability problems in health information exchange was extended to evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge with the EBMonFHIR project. A 13-step Code System Development Protocol was created in September 2020 to support global development of terminologies for exchange of scientific evidence. For Step 1, we assembled expert working groups with 55 people from 26 countries by October 2020. For Step 2, we identified 23 commonly used tools and systems for which the first version of code systems will be developed. For Step 3, a total of 368 non-redundant concepts were drafted to become display terms for four code systems (Statistic Type, Statistic Model, Study Design, Risk of Bias). Steps 4 through 13 will guide ongoing development and maintenance of these terminologies for scientific exchange. When completed, the code systems will facilitate identifying, processing, and reporting research results and the reliability of those results. More efficient and detailed scientific communication will reduce cost and burden and improve health outcomes, quality of life, and patient, caregiver, and healthcare professional satisfaction. We hope the achievements reached thus far will outlive COVID-19 and provide an infrastructure to make science computable for future generations.

In this sense, the countries have had difficulties in counting the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Errors in reporting results are a common factor, as well as the lack of interoperability between laboratories and governments. Approaches aimed at sending spreadsheets via email expose patients' privacy and have increased the probability of errors due to retyping, which generates a delay in the notification of results. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to design and develop an interoperable platform to report polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government. METHODS: The methodology to design and develop the interoperable platform was comprised of six well-structured stages: (1) creation of a minimum data set for PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, (2) modeling processes and end points where institutions interchange information, (3) standards and interoperability design, (4) software development, (5) software testing, and (6) software implementation. RESULTS: The interoperable Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) platform to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government was successfully implemented. The platform was designed, developed, tested, and implemented following a structured methodology. The platform's performance to 1000 requests resulted in a response time of 240 milliseconds, throughput of 28.3 requests per second, and process management time of 131 milliseconds. The security was assured through a private network exclusive to the Ministry of Health to ensure confidentiality and integrity. The authorization and authentication of laboratories were implemented with a JavaScript Object Notation Web Token. All the PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests were accessible through an application programming interface gateway with valid credentials and the right access control list. CONCLUSIONS: The platform was implemented and is currently being used by UC Christus Laboratory. The platform is secure. It was tested adequately for confidentiality, secure authorization, authentication, and message integrity.

While this research provides important insights, the multitude of studies results in an increasing fragmentation of information. To ensure comparability across projects and institutions, standard datasets are needed. Here, we introduce the "German Corona Consensus Dataset" (GECCO), a uniform dataset that uses international terminologies and health IT standards to improve interoperability of COVID-19 data, in particular for university medicine. METHODS: Based on previous work (e.g., the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form) and in coordination with experts from university hospitals, professional associations and research initiatives, data elements relevant for COVID-19 research were collected, prioritized and consolidated into a compact core dataset. The dataset was mapped to international terminologies, and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was used to define interoperable, machine-readable data formats. RESULTS: A core dataset consisting of 81 data elements with 281 response options was defined, including information about, for example, demography, medical history, symptoms, therapy, medications or laboratory values of COVID-19 patients. Data elements and response options were mapped to SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, ICD-10-GM and ATC, and FHIR profiles for interoperable data exchange were defined. CONCLUSION: GECCO provides a compact, interoperable dataset that can help to make COVID-19 research data more comparable across studies and institutions. The dataset will be further refined in the future by adding domain-specific extension modules for more specialized use cases.', 'FAU': ['Sass, Julian', 'Bartschke, Alexander', 'Lehne, Moritz', 'Essenwanger, Andrea', 'Rinaldi, Eugenia', 'Rudolph, Stefanie', 'Heitmann, Kai U', 'Vehreschild, Jorg J', 'von Kalle, Christof', 'Thun, Sylvia'], 'AU': ['Sass J', 'Bartschke A', 'Lehne M', 'Essenwanger A', 'Rinaldi E', 'Rudolph S', 'Heitmann KU', 'Vehreschild JJ', 'von Kalle C', 'Thun S'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-2068-7765', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8435-1374', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0042-8088', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7643-3871', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5446-7170', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9221-3297', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3346-6806'], 'AD': ['Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'HIH - Health Innovation Hub of the Federal Ministry of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Medical Department 2, Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department I for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research, Partner Site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany. sylvia.thun@charite.de.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. sylvia.thun@charite.de.', 'Hochschule Niederrhein - University of Applied Sciences, Krefeld, Germany. sylvia.thun@charite.de.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20201221', 'PL': 'England', 'TA': 'BMC Med Inform Decis Mak', 'JT': 'BMC medical informatics and decision making', 'JID': '101088682', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['*Biomedical Research', '*COVID-19', 'Consensus', '*Datasets as Topic', 'Humans', '*Medicine', 'Pandemics'], 'PMC': 'PMC7751265', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['COVID-19', 'FHIR', 'Interoperability', 'Standard dataset'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'], 'EDAT': '2020/12/23 06:00', 'MHDA': '2020/12/30 06:00', 'PMCR': ['2020/12/21'], 'CRDT': ['2020/12/22 05:32'], 'PHST': ['2020/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/12/22 05:32 [entrez]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/12/21 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['10.1186/s12911-020-01374-w [pii]', '1374 [pii]', '10.1186/s12911-020-01374-w [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2020 Dec 21;20(1):341. doi: 10.1186/s12911-020-01374-w.'}

COVID-19's emergence and rapid spread is a global public health and economic crisis. However, investigations into the disease, patient-tracking mechanisms, and case report transmissions are both labor-intensive and slow. OBJECTIVE: The pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems, forcing hospitals and medical facilities to find effective ways to share data. This study aims to design a global infectious disease surveillance and case tracking system that can facilitate the detection and control of COVID-19. METHODS: The International Patient Summary (IPS; an electronic health record that contains essential health care information about a patient) was used. The IPS was designed to support the used case scenario for unplanned cross-border care. The design, scope, utility, and potential for reuse of the IPS for unplanned cross-border care make it suitable for situations like COVID-19. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources confirmed that IPS data, which includes symptoms, therapies, medications, and laboratory data, can be efficiently transferred and exchanged on the system for easy access by physicians. To protect privacy, patient data are deidentified. All systems are protected by blockchain architecture, including data encryption, validation, and exchange of records. RESULTS: To achieve worldwide COVID-19 surveillance, a global infectious disease information exchange must be enacted. The COVID-19 surveillance system was designed based on blockchain architecture. The IPS was used to exchange case study information among physicians. After being verified, physicians can upload IPS files and receive IPS data from other global cases. The system includes a daily IPS uploading and enhancement plan, which covers real-time uploading through the interoperation of the clinic system, with the module based on the Open Application Programming Interface architecture. Through the treatment of different cases, drug treatments, and the exchange of treatment results, the disease spread can be controlled, and treatment methods can be funded. In the Infectious Disease Case Tracking module, we can track the moving paths of infectious disease cases. The location information recorded in the blockchain is used to check the locations of different cases. The Case Tracking module was established for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track cases and prevent disease spread. CONCLUSIONS: We created the IPS of infectious diseases for physicians treating patients with COVID-19. Our system can help health authorities respond quickly to the transmission and spread of unknown diseases, and provides a system for information retrieval on disease transmission. In addition, this system can help researchers form trials and analyze data from different countries. A common forum to facilitate the mutual sharing of experiences, best practices, therapies, useful medications, and clinical intervention outcomes from research in various countries could help control an unknown virus. This system could be an effective tool for global collaboration in evidence-based efforts to fight COVID-19.", 'CI': ['(c)Hsiu-An Lee, Hsin-Hua Kung, Yuarn-Jang Lee, Jane C-J Chao, Jai Ganesh', 'Udayasankaran, Hueng-Chuen Fan, Kwok-Keung Ng, Yu-Kang Chang, Boonchai', 'Kijsanayotin, Alvin B Marcelo, Chien-Yeh Hsu.

Gaps in the referral process lead to delays in patients' access to care, negative patient experience, worse health outcomes, and increased operational costs. While implementation of standards-based electronic referral options can alleviate some of these inefficiencies, many referrals to tertiary and quaternary care centers continue to be sent via fax. OBJECTIVE: We describe the design process and architecture for a software application that has been developed and deployed to optimize the referrals intake process by automating the processing and digitization of incoming specialty referral faxes, extracting key data elements and integrating them into the electronic health record (EHR), and organizing referrals. METHODS: A human-centered design approach was used to identify and describe the inefficiencies in the external referral process at our large, urban tertiary care center. Referrals Automation, an application to convert referral faxes to digital referrals in the EHR, was conceptualized based on key stakeholder interviews and time and motion studies. This application was designed using Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) platforms to allow for adaptability into other healthcare organizations. RESULTS: Referrals Automation software was developed as a healthcare information technology solution to streamline the fax to referral process. The application was implemented into several specialty clinics. Metrics were built-in to the applications to evaluate and guide the further iteration of these features. CONCLUSIONS: Referrals Automation will enhance the referrals process by further streamlining and organizing the patient referral process.", 'CI': ['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Many oncology data elements (eg, staging, biomarkers, documentation of adverse events and cancer outcomes) remain challenging. The Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) project is a consensus data standard created to facilitate transmission of data of patients with cancer. METHODS: In 2018, mCODE was developed through a work group convened by ASCO, including oncologists, informaticians, researchers, and experts in terminologies and standards. The mCODE specification is organized by 6 high-level domains: patient, laboratory/vital, disease, genomics, treatment, and outcome. In total, 23 mCODE profiles are composed of 90 data elements. RESULTS: A conceptual model was published for public comment in January 2019 and, after additional refinement, the first public version of the mCODE (version 0.9.1) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) implementation guide (IG) was presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2019. The specification was approved for balloting by Health Level 7 International (HL7) in August 2019. mCODE passed the HL7 ballot in September 2019 with 86.5% approval. The mCODE IG authors worked with HL7 reviewers to resolve all negative comments, leading to a modest expansion in the number of data elements and tighter alignment with FHIR and other HL7 conventions. The mCODE version 1.0 FHIR IG Standard for Trial Use was formally published on March 18, 2020. CONCLUSION: The mCODE project has the potential to offer tremendous benefits to cancer care delivery and research by creating an infrastructure to better share patient data. mCODE is available free from www.mCODEinitiative.org.

Despite recent progress, current phenotyping approaches are manual, time-consuming, error-prone, and platform-specific. This results in duplication of effort and highly variable results across systems and institutions, and is not scalable or portable. In this work, we investigate how the nascent Clinical Quality Language (CQL) can address these issues and enable high-throughput, cross-platform phenotyping. METHODS: We selected a clinically validated heart failure (HF) phenotype definition and translated it into CQL, then developed a CQL execution engine to integrate with the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) platform. We executed the phenotype definition at two large academic medical centers, Northwestern Medicine and Weill Cornell Medicine, and conducted results verification (n = 100) to determine precision and recall. We additionally executed the same phenotype definition against two different data platforms, OHDSI and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), using the same underlying dataset and compared the results. RESULTS: CQL is expressive enough to represent the HF phenotype definition, including Boolean and aggregate operators, and temporal relationships between data elements. The language design also enabled the implementation of a custom execution engine with relative ease, and results verification at both sites revealed that precision and recall were both 100%. Cross-platform execution resulted in identical patient cohorts generated by both data platforms. CONCLUSIONS: CQL supports the representation of arbitrarily complex phenotype definitions, and our execution engine implementation demonstrated cross-platform execution against two widely used clinical data platforms. The language thus has the potential to help address current limitations with portability in EHR-driven phenotyping and scale in learning health systems.', 'CI': ['(c) 2020 The Authors.

The meaningful combination of omics data, ie, pathogenic gene variants and alterations with other patient data, to understand the full picture of malignancy has been challenging. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the implementation of a system capable of processing, analyzing, and subsequently combining NGS data with other clinical patient data for analysis within and across institutions. METHODS: On the basis of the already existing NGS analysis workflows for the identification of malignant gene variants at the Institute of Pathology of the University Hospital Erlangen, we defined basic requirements on an NGS processing and analysis pipeline and implemented a pipeline based on the GEMINI (GEnome MINIng) open source genetic variation database. For the purpose of validation, this pipeline was applied to data from the 1000 Genomes Project and subsequently to NGS data derived from 206 patients of a local hospital. We further integrated the pipeline into existing structures of data integration centers at the University Hospital Erlangen and combined NGS data with local nongenomic patient-derived data available in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources format. RESULTS: Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and from the patient cohort as input, the implemented system produced the same results as already established methodologies. Further, it satisfied all our identified requirements and was successfully integrated into the existing infrastructure. Finally, we showed in an exemplary analysis how the data could be quickly loaded into and analyzed in KETOS, a web-based analysis platform for statistical analysis and clinical decision support. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the GEMINI open source database can be augmented to create an NGS analysis pipeline. The pipeline generates high-quality results consistent with the already established workflows for gene variant annotation and pathological evaluation. We further demonstrate how NGS-derived genomic and other clinical data can be combined for further statistical analysis, thereby providing for data integration using standardized vocabularies and methods. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the pipeline integration into hospital workflows by providing an exemplary integration into the data integration center infrastructure, which is currently being established across Germany.', 'CI': ['(c)Julian Gruendner, Nicolas Wolf, Lars Togel, Florian Haller, Hans-Ulrich', 'Prokosch, Jan Christoph.

Although few question the importance of NGS in modern oncology care, the process of gathering primary molecular data, integrating it into electronic health records, and optimally using it as part of a clinical workflow remains far from seamless. Numerous challenges persist around data standards and interoperability, and clinicians frequently face difficulties in managing the growing amount of genomic knowledge required to care for patients and keep up to date. METHODS: This review provides a descriptive analysis of genomic data workflows for NGS data in clinical oncology and issues that arise from the inconsistent use of standards for sharing data across systems. Potential solutions are described. RESULTS: NGS technology, especially for somatic genomics, is well established and widely used in routine patient care, quality measurement, and research. Available genomic knowledge bases play an evolving role in patient management but lack harmonization with one another. Questions about their provenance and timeliness of updating remain. Potentially useful standards for sharing genomic data, such as HL7 FHIR and mCODE, remain primarily in the research and/or development stage. Nonetheless, their impact will likely be seen as uptake increases across care settings and laboratories. The specific use case of ASCO CancerLinQ, as a clinicogenomic database, is discussed. CONCLUSION: Because the electronic health records of today seem ill suited for managing genomic data, other solutions are required, including universal data standards and applications that use application programming interfaces, along with a commitment on the part of sequencing laboratories to consistently provide structured genomic data for clinical use.', 'CI': ['(c) 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'], 'FAU': ['Conway, Jake R', 'Warner, Jeremy L', 'Rubinstein, Wendy S', 'Miller, Robert S'], 'AU': ['Conway JR', 'Warner JL', 'Rubinstein WS', 'Miller RS'], 'AD': ['Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology, Alexandria, VA.', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology, Alexandria, VA.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'GR': ['F31 CA239347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HG002295/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA231840/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', 'Review'], 'DEP': '20191001', 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'JCO Precis Oncol', 'JT': 'JCO precision oncology', 'JID': '101705370', 'PMC': 'PMC7446333', 'COIS': ['The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this', 'manuscript.

These compact representations often express complex and nuanced medical conditions, making their semantics challenging to fully capture and standardize. In this study, we describe a framework for transforming free-text problem descriptions into standardized Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) models. This approach leverages a combination of domain-specific dependency parsers, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) natural language models, and cui2vec Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concept vectors to align extracted concepts from free-text problem descriptions into structured FHIR models. A neural network classification model is used to classify thirteen relationship types between concepts, facilitating mapping to the FHIR Condition resource. We use data programming, a weak supervision approach, to eliminate the need for a manually annotated training corpus. Shapley values, a mechanism to quantify contribution, are used to interpret the impact of model features. We found that our methods identified the focus concept, or primary clinical concern of the problem description, with an F(1) score of 0.95. Relationships from the focus to other modifying concepts were extracted with an F(1) score of 0.90. When classifying relationships, our model achieved a 0.89 weighted average F(1) score, enabling accurate mapping of attributes into HL7 FHIR models. We also found that the BERT input representation predominantly contributed to the classifier decision as shown by the Shapley values analysis.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are no standard implementation guidelines for data items from the proposed standard at the clinical site and no guidelines or references for implementing gene sequencing data results for clinical use. This is a significant challenge for implementation and application of these standards at individual sites. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the field utilization of genetic test reports by designing the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for genomic data elements based on the ISO/TS 20428 standard published as the standard for genomic test reports. The goal of this pilot is to facilitate the reporting and viewing of genomic data for clinical applications. FHIR Genomics resources predominantly focus on transmitting or representing sequencing data, which is of less clinical value. METHODS: In this study, we describe the practical implementation of ISO/TS 20428 using HL7 FHIR Genomics implementation guidance to efficiently deliver the required genomic sequencing results to clinicians through an EHR system. RESULTS: We successfully administered a structured genomic sequencing report in a tertiary hospital in Korea based on international standards. In total, 90 FHIR resources were used. Among 41 resources for the required fields, 26 were reused and 15 were extended. For the optional fields, 28 were reused and 21 were extended. CONCLUSIONS: To share and apply genomic sequencing data in both clinical practice and translational research, it is essential to identify the applicability of the standard-based information system in a practical setting. This prototyping work shows that reporting data from clinical genomics sequencing can be effectively implemented into an EHR system using the existing ISO/TS 20428 standard and FHIR resources.', 'CI': ['(c)Borim Ryu, Soo-Yong Shin, Rong-Min Baek, Jeong-Whun Kim, Eunyoung Heo, Inchul', 'Kang, Joshua SungWoo Yang, Sooyoung Yoo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a chronic disease management application using the technology framework known as SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources). We used mixed methods to obtain user feedback on a prototype to support ambulatory providers managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Each participant managed 2 patient scenarios using the regular EHR with and without access to our prototype in block-randomized order. The primary outcome was the percentage of expert-recommended ideal care tasks completed. Timing, keyboard and mouse use, and participant surveys were also collected. User experiences were captured using a retrospective think-aloud interview analyzed by concept coding. RESULTS: With our prototype, the 13 participants completed more recommended care (81% vs 48%; P < .001) and recommended tasks per minute (0.8 vs 0.6; P = .03) over longer sessions (7.0 minutes vs 5.4 minutes; P = .006). Keystrokes per task were lower with the prototype (6 vs 18; P < .001). Qualitative themes elicited included the desire for reliable presentation of information which matches participants' mental models of disease and for intuitive navigation in order to decrease cognitive load. DISCUSSION: Participants completed more recommended care by taking more time when using our prototype. Interviews identified a tension between using the inefficient but familiar EHR vs learning to use our novel prototype. Concept coding of user feedback generated actionable insights.

One of the challenges with a fast-moving outbreak is to accurately assess its demand on healthcare resources, since information specific to comorbidities is often not available. These comorbidities are often associated with poor prognosis and higher resource utilization. If the comorbidity data and other clinical information were readily available to public health workers, they could better address community disruption and manage healthcare resources.

The ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registry (MDR) standard has been highlighted as a solution for standardizing and registering clinical data elements (DEs). However, the standard model has both structural and semantic limitations, and the number of DEs continues to increase due to poor term reusability. Semantic types and constraints are lacking for comprehensively describing and evaluating DEs on real-world clinical documents. METHODS: We addressed these limitations by defining three new types of semantic relationship (dependency, composite, and variable) in our previous studies. The present study created new and further extended existing semantic types (hybrid atomic and repeated and dictionary composite common data elements [CDEs]) with four constraints: ordered, operated, required, and dependent. For evaluation, we extracted all atomic and composite CDEs from five major clinical documents from five teaching hospitals in Korea, 14 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) resources from FHIR bulk sample data, and MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) demo dataset. Metadata reusability and semantic interoperability in real clinical settings were comprehensively evaluated by applying the CDEs with our extended semantic types and constraints. RESULTS: All of the CDEs (n = 1142) extracted from the 25 clinical documents were successfully integrated with a very high CDE reuse ratio (46.9%) into 586 CDEs (259 atomic and 20 unique composite CDEs), and all of CDEs (n = 238) extracted from the 14 FHIR resources of FHIR bulk sample data were successfully integrated with high CDE reuse ration (59.7%) into 96 CDEs (21 atomic and 28 unique composite CDEs), which improved the semantic integrity and interoperability without any semantic loss. Moreover, the most complex data structures from two CDE projects were successfully encoded with rich semantics and semantic integrity. CONCLUSION: MDR-based extended semantic types and constraints can facilitate comprehensive representation of clinical documents with rich semantics, and improved semantic interoperability without semantic loss.', 'FAU': ['Kim, Hye Hyeon', 'Park, Yu Rang', 'Lee, Suehyun', 'Kim, Ju Han'], 'AU': ['Kim HH', 'Park YR', 'Lee S', 'Kim JH'], 'AD': ['Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI), Division of Biomedical Informatics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Systems Informatics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, Konyang University, Daejeon, 35365, Republic of Korea.', 'Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI), Division of Biomedical Informatics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea. juhan@snu.ac.kr.'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0003-1522-9038'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'GR': ['HI18C2386/Korean Health Technology R&amp;D Project, Ministry of Health and', 'Welfare/International'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], 'DEP': '20200703', 'PL': 'England', 'TA': 'BMC Med Inform Decis Mak', 'JT': 'BMC medical informatics and decision making', 'JID': '101088682', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['*Common Data Elements', '*Metadata', 'Registries', 'Republic of Korea', 'Semantics'], 'PMC': 'PMC7333279', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Common data elements', 'Metadata registry', 'Semantic interoperability', 'Semantic relationship'], 'COIS': ['None of the authors has conflicts of interest with other persons or organizations', 'that could inappropriately influence their work.'], 'EDAT': '2020/07/06 06:00', 'MHDA': '2020/12/31 06:00', 'PMCR': ['2020/07/03'], 'CRDT': ['2020/07/05 06:00'], 'PHST': ['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/03 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['10.1186/s12911-020-01168-0 [pii]', '1168 [pii]', '10.1186/s12911-020-01168-0 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2020 Jul 3;20(1):147. doi: 10.1186/s12911-020-01168-0.'}

GO FAIR - a bottom-up, stakeholder driven and self-governed initiative - defined a seven-step FAIRification process focusing on data, but also indicating the required work for metadata. This FAIRification process aims at addressing the translation of raw datasets into FAIR datasets in a general way, without considering specific requirements and challenges that may arise when dealing with some particular types of data. OBJECTIVES: This scientific contribution addresses the architecture design of an open technological solution built upon the FAIRification process proposed by "GO FAIR" which addresses the identified gaps that such process has when dealing with health datasets. METHODS: A common FAIRification workflow was developed by applying restrictions on existing steps and introducing new steps for specific requirements of health data. These requirements have been elicited after analyzing the FAIRification workflow from different perspectives: technical barriers, ethical implications, and legal framework. This analysis identified gaps when applying the FAIRification process proposed by GO FAIR to health research data management in terms of data curation, validation, deidentification, versioning, and indexing. RESULTS: A technological architecture based on the use of Health Level Seven International (HL7) FHIR (fast health care interoperability resources) resources is proposed to support the revised FAIRification workflow. DISCUSSION: Research funding agencies all over the world increasingly demand the application of the FAIR guiding principles to health research output. Existing tools do not fully address the identified needs for health data management. Therefore, researchers may benefit in the coming years from a common framework that supports the proposed FAIRification workflow applied to health datasets.

We implemented, described, and applied a cloud computing solution utilizing the fast health interoperability resources (FHIR) standardization and state-of-the-art parallel distributed computing platform for advanced analytics. METHODS: We utilized the architecture of the modern predictive analytics platform called Cerner(R) HealtheDataLab and described the suite of cloud computing services and Apache Projects that it relies on. We validated the platform by replicating and improving on a previous single pediatric institution study/model on readmission and developing a multi-center model of all-cause readmission for pediatric-age patients using the Cerner(R) Health Facts Deidentified Database (now updated and referred to as the Cerner Real World Data). We retrieved a subset of 1.4 million pediatric encounters consisting of 48 hospitals' data on pediatric encounters in the database based on a priori inclusion criteria. We built and analyzed corresponding random forest and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network models using HealtheDataLab. RESULTS: Using the HealtheDataLab platform, we developed a random forest model and multi-layer perceptron model with AUC of 0.8446 (0.8444, 0.8447) and 0.8451 (0.8449, 0.8453) respectively. We showed the distribution in model performance across hospitals and identified a set of novel variables under previous resource utilization and generic medications that may be used to improve existing readmission models.

Patients' records are however distributed in data silos across multiple healthcare facilities, posing technical and clinical challenges that may endanger patients' safety. Current healthcare sharing systems ensure interoperability of patients' records across facilities, but they have limits in presenting doctors with the clinical context of the data in the records. We design and implement a platform for managing provenance tracking of Electronic Healthcare Records based on blockchain technology, compliant with the latest healthcare standards and following the patient-informed consent preferences. METHODS: The platform leverages two pillars: the use of international standards such as Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), Health Level Seven International (HL7) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to achieve interoperability, and the use of a provenance creation process that by-design, avoids personal data storage within the blockchain. The platform consists of: (1) a smart contract implemented within the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain that manages provenance according to the W3C PROV for medical document in standardised formats (e.g. a CDA document, a FHIR resource, a DICOM study, etc.); (2) a Java Proxy that intercepts all the document submissions and retrievals for which provenance shall be evaluated; (3) a service used to retrieve the PROV document. RESULTS: We integrated our decentralised platform with the SpiritEHR engine, an enterprise-grade healthcare system, and we stored and retrieved the available documents in the Mandel's sample CDA repository,(1) which contained no protected health information. Using a cloud-based blockchain solution, we observed that the overhead added to the typical processing time of reading and writing medical data is in the order of milliseconds. Moreover, the integration of the Proxy at the level of exchanged messages in EHR systems allows transparent usage of provenance data in multiple health computing domains such as decision making, data reconciliation, and patient consent auditing. CONCLUSIONS: By using international healthcare standards and a cloud-based blockchain deployment, we delivered a solution that can manage provenance of patients' records via transparent integration within the routine operations on healthcare data.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To this, Data Integration Centers are set up at university medical centers, which address data harmonization, information security and data protection. To capture patient consent, a common informed consent template has been developed. It consists of different modules addressing permissions for using data and biosamples. On the technical level, a common digital representation of information from signed consent templates is needed. As the partners in the initiative are free to adopt different solutions for managing consent information (e.g. IHE BPPC or HL7 FHIR Consent Resources), we had to develop an interoperability layer. METHODS: First, we compiled an overview of data items required to reflect the information from the MII consent template as well as patient preferences and derived permissions. Next, we created entity-relationship diagrams to formally describe the conceptual data model underlying relevant items. We then compared this data model to conceptual models describing representations of consent information using different interoperability standards. We used the result of this comparison to derive an interoperable representation that can be mapped to common standards. RESULTS: The digital representation needs to capture the following information: (1) version of the consent, (2) consent status for each module, and (3) period of validity of the status. We found that there is no generally accepted solution to represent status information in a manner interoperable with all relevant standards. Hence, we developed a pragmatic solution, comprising codes which describe combinations of modules with a basic set of status labels. We propose to maintain these codes in a public registry called ART-DECOR. We present concrete technical implementations of our approach using HL7 FHIR and IHE BPPC which are also compatible with the open-source consent management software gICS. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed digital representation is (1) generic enough to capture relevant information from a wide range of consent documents and data use regulations and (2) interoperable with common technical standards. We plan to extend our model to include more fine-grained status codes and rules for automated access control.', 'FAU': ['Bild, Raffael', 'Bialke, Martin', 'Buckow, Karoline', 'Ganslandt, Thomas', 'Ihrig, Kristina', 'Jahns, Roland', 'Merzweiler, Angela', 'Roschka, Sybille', 'Schreiweis, Bjorn', 'Staubert, Sebastian', 'Zenker, Sven', 'Prasser, Fabian'], 'AU': ['Bild R', 'Bialke M', 'Buckow K', 'Ganslandt T', 'Ihrig K', 'Jahns R', 'Merzweiler A', 'Roschka S', 'Schreiweis B', 'Staubert S', 'Zenker S', 'Prasser F'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-7398-5598'], 'AD': ['Technical University of Munich, School of Medicine, Institute of Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675, Munich, Germany. raffael.bild@tum.de.', 'Institute for Community Medicine, Department Epidemiology of Health Care and Community Health, University Medicine Greifswald, Ellernholzstr 1-2, 17487, Greifswald, Germany.', 'TMF - Technology, Methods, and Infrastructure for Networked Medical Research, Charlottenstrasse 42, 10117, Berlin, Germany.', 'Heinrich-Lanz-Center for Digital Health, University Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer 1-3, 68167, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Interdisciplinary Bank of Biomaterials and Data Wurzburg, University and University Hospital Wurzburg, Straubmuhlweg 2a, 97078, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Information Systems, Heidelberg University Hospital, Im Neuenheimer Feld 130.3, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Community Medicine, Department Epidemiology of Health Care and Community Health, University Medicine Greifswald, Ellernholzstr 1-2, 17487, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Statistics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein and Kiel University, Arnold-Heller-Str. 3, 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, Universitat Leipzig, Hartelstrasse 16-18, 04107, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Staff Unit for Medical & Scientific Technology Development & Coordination, Commercial Directorate, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department Of Anesthesiology & Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Biometrics, Informatics & Epidemiology, University of Bonn, Venusbergcampus 1, 53127, Bonn, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Chariteplatz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Anna-Louisa-Karsch-Str. 2, 10178, Berlin, Germany.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'GR': ['01ZZ1804A-I/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1801A-M/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1601/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1801A-M/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1801A-M/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1802A-X/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1802A-X/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1801A-M/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1802A-X/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1803A-R/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1803A-R/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International', '01ZZ1802A-X/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung/International'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], 'DEP': '20200605', 'PL': 'England', 'TA': 'BMC Med Inform Decis Mak', 'JT': 'BMC medical informatics and decision making', 'JID': '101088682', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['*Computer Security', 'Germany', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', '*Medical Informatics', 'Software'], 'PMC': 'PMC7275462', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Consent template', 'Data integration centers', 'Health information interoperability', 'Informed consent', 'Medical informatics initiative'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'], 'EDAT': '2020/06/07 06:00', 'MHDA': '2021/01/06 06:00', 'PMCR': ['2020/06/05'], 'CRDT': ['2020/06/07 06:00'], 'PHST': ['2019/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['10.1186/s12911-020-01138-6 [pii]', '1138 [pii]', '10.1186/s12911-020-01138-6 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2020 Jun 5;20(1):103. doi: 10.1186/s12911-020-01138-6.'}

We aimed to develop and validate an automated Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based 12-lead ECG mobile alert system for use in an emergency department (ED). MATERIALS AND METHODS: An automated FHIR-based 12-lead ECG alert system was developed in the ED of an academic tertiary care hospital. The system was aimed at generating an alert for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome based on interpretation by the legacy device. The alert is transmitted to physicians both via a mobile application and the patient's electronic medical record (EMR). The automated FHIR-based 12-lead ECG alert system processing interval was defined as the time from ED arrival and 12-lead ECG capture to the time when the FHIR-based notification was transmitted. RESULTS: During the study period, 3812 emergency visits and 1581 12-lead ECGs were recorded. The FHIR system generated 155 alerts for 116 patients. The alerted patients were significantly older [mean (standard deviation): 68.1 (12.4) years vs. 59.6 (16.8) years, p<0.001], and the cardiac-related symptom rate was higher (34.5% vs. 19%, p<0.001). Among the 155 alerts, 146 (94%) were transmitted successfully within 5 minutes. The median interval from 12-lead ECG capture to FHIR notification was 2.7 min [interquartile range (IQR) 2.2-3.1 min] for the group with cardiac-related symptoms and 3.0 min (IQR 2.5-3.4 min) for the group with non-cardiac-related symptoms.

This article discusses lessons learned from recent Sync for Genes activities. OBJECTIVES: The goals of Sync for Genes were to (1) demonstrate exchange of genomic data using health data standards, (2) provide feedback for refinement of health data standards, and (3) synthesize project experiences to support the integration of genomic data at the point-of-care and for research. METHODS: Four organizations participated in a program to test the Health Level Seven International (HL7((R))) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR((R))) standard, which supports sharing genomic data. ONC provided access to subject matter experts, resources, tools, and technical guidance to support testing activities. Three of the four organizations participated in HL7 FHIR Connectathons to test FHIR\'s ability to exchange genomic diagnostic reports. RESULTS: The organizations successfully demonstrated exchange of genomic diagnostic reports using FHIR. The feedback and artifacts that resulted from these activities were shared with HL7 and made publicly available. Four areas were identified as important considerations for similar projects: (1) FHIR proficiency, (2) developer support, (3) project scope, and (4) bridging health information technology and genomic expertise.

These systems focus on reducing the time it takes for a user to get to information present in electronic health records (EHRs). Directly annotating questions with logical forms is a challenging task and involves a time-consuming step of concept normalization annotation. We aim to automate this step using the normalized codes present in a FHIR resource. Using the proposed approach, two annotators curated an annotated dataset of 1000 questions in less than 1 week.

The article implements a method to evaluate the preliminary content overlap of proprietary medical formats, including national terminologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-international medical standard. METHODS:  Three types of mappings were evaluated in the article: proprietary format matched to FHIR, national terminologies matched to the FHIR mappings, and concepts from national terminologies matched to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). We matched attributes of the formats with FHIR definitions and calculated content overlap. RESULTS:  The article reports the results of a manual mapping between a proprietary medical format and the FHIR standard. The following results were obtained: 81% of content overlap for the proprietary format to FHIR mapping, 88% of content overlap for the national terminologies to FHIR mapping, and 98.6% of concepts matching can be reached from national terminologies to SNOMED CT mapping. Twenty tables from the proprietary format and 20 dictionaries were matched with FHIR resources; nine dictionaries were matched with SNOMED CT concepts.

Such tools are needed to support research in environmental health and any biomedical field that is challenged by the need for integrated spatiotemporal data to examine individual-level determinants of health and disease. RESULTS: We have developed an open-source software application-FHIR PIT (Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Patient data Integration Tool)-to enable studies on the impact of individual-level environmental exposures on health and disease. FHIR PIT was motivated by the need to integrate patient data derived from our institution's clinical warehouse with a variety of public data sources on environmental exposures and then openly expose the data via ICEES (Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service). FHIR PIT consists of transformation steps or building blocks that can be chained together to form a transformation and integration workflow. Several transformation steps are generic and thus can be reused. As such, new types of data can be incorporated into the modular FHIR PIT pipeline by simply reusing generic steps or adding new ones. We validated FHIR PIT in the context of a driving use case designed to investigate the impact of airborne pollutant exposures on asthma. Specifically, we replicated published findings demonstrating racial disparities in the impact of airborne pollutants on asthma exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: While FHIR PIT was developed to support our driving use case on asthma, the software can be used to integrate any type and number of spatiotemporal data sources at a level of granularity that enables individual-level study.

The modeling capability of FHIR in standardizing cancer data has been gaining increasing attention by the cancer research informatics community. However, few studies have been conducted to examine the capability of FHIR in electronic data capture (EDC) applications for effective cancer clinical trials. The objective of this study was to design, develop, and evaluate an FHIR-based method that enables the automation of the case report forms (CRFs) population for cancer clinical trials using real-world electronic health records (EHRs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed an FHIR-based computational pipeline of EDC with a case study for modeling colorectal cancer trials. We first leveraged an existing FHIR-based cancer profile to represent EHR data of patients with colorectal cancer, and then we used the FHIR Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse resources to represent the CRFs and their data population. To test the accuracy of and overall quality of the computational pipeline, we used synoptic reports of 287 Mayo Clinic patients with colorectal cancer from 2013 to 2019 with standard measures of precision, recall, and F1 score. RESULTS: Using the computational pipeline, a total of 1,037 synoptic reports were successfully converted as the instances of the FHIR-based cancer profile. The average accuracy for converting all data elements (excluding tumor perforation) of the cancer profile was 0.99, using 200 randomly selected records. The average F1 score for populating nine questions of the CRFs in a real-world colorectal cancer trial was 0.95, using 100 randomly selected records. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that it is feasible to populate CRFs with EHR data in an automated manner with satisfactory performance.

However, the different requirements concerning type, performance and quality assurance of available communication services within the different healthcare sectors still require that the hospitals participate in various secure communication networks which have to be bridged for cross-sectoral communication. Cross-institutional pathways for telemedicine, however, can be mapped both within and across sectoral boundaries via automated process chains using the IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) defined integration profile CrossEnterprise Document Sharing (XDS) and associated integration profiles. The provision of medical documents in a cross-institutional patient record outside of defined medical pathways requires differentiated authorization management.

METHODS: We established an FHIR-based clinical data normalization pipeline known as NLP2FHIR that mainly comprises: (1) a module for a core natural language processing (NLP) engine with an FHIR-based type system; (2) a module for integrating structured data; and (3) a module for content normalization. We evaluated the FHIR modeling capability focusing on core clinical resources such as Condition, Procedure, MedicationStatement (including Medication), and FamilyMemberHistory using Mayo Clinic's unstructured EHR data. We constructed a gold standard reusing annotation corpora from previous NLP projects. RESULTS: A total of 30 mapping rules, 62 normalization rules, and 11 NLP-specific FHIR extensions were created and implemented in the NLP2FHIR pipeline. The elements that need to integrate structured data from each clinical resource were identified. The performance of unstructured data modeling achieved F scores ranging from 0.69 to 0.99 for various FHIR element representations (0.69-0.99 for Condition; 0.75-0.84 for Procedure; 0.71-0.99 for MedicationStatement; and 0.75-0.95 for FamilyMemberHistory). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the NLP2FHIR pipeline is feasible for modeling unstructured EHR data and integrating structured elements into the model.

With prior experience in developing apps for the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), we sought to make collecting patient-generated health data (PGHD) a fundamental property of health information technology at scale, and in an interoperable, standards-compliant fashion. We build upon the open SMART on FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) specification to create SMART Markers-a mobile device software framework encapsulating functionality needed for rapid deployment of both patient- and practitioner-facing PGHD apps. We refactored previously developed PROMIS apps to use SMART Markers for handling PGHD-request creation, on-device administration, and generation of a variety of PGHD types and submission of results to a FHIR server. Validation and conformance tests were performed on the generated output and app-reusability was demonstrated across two demo servers. App developers can import SMART Markers into their existing or new apps to readily leverage an interoperable PGHD capturing functionality out of the box, without having to reinvent the wheel.

We explored three thematic areas to assess the current state of API use for data access and exchange in health care: (1) API use cases and standards; (2) challenges and facilitators for read and write capabilities; and (3) outlook for development of write capabilities. METHODS: We employed four methods: (1) literature review; (2) expert interviews with 13 API stakeholders; (3) review of electronic health record (EHR) app galleries; and (4) a technical expert panel. We used an eight-dimension sociotechnical model to organize our findings. RESULTS: The API ecosystem is complicated and cuts across five of the eight sociotechnical model dimensions: (1) app marketplaces support a range of use cases, the majority of which target providers' needs, with far fewer supporting patient access to data; (2) current focus on read APIs with limited use of write APIs; (3) where standards are used, they are largely Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR); (4) FHIR-based APIs support exchange of electronic health information within the common clinical data set; and (5) validating external data and data sources for clinical decision making creates challenges to provider workflows. CONCLUSION: While the use of APIs in health care is increasing rapidly, it is still in the pilot stages. We identified five key issues with implications for the continued advancement of API use: (1) a robust normative FHIR standard; (2) expansion of the common clinical data set to other data elements; (3) enhanced support for write implementation; (4) data provenance rules; and (5) data governance rules. Thus, while APIs are being touted as a solution to interoperability challenges, they remain an emerging technology that is only one piece of a multipronged approach to data access and use.", 'CI': ['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Whilst Clinical Guidelines (CGs) focus on the correct prescription of antibiotics in a narrative form, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) operationalize the knowledge contained in CGs in the form of rules at the point of care. Despite the efforts made to computerize CGs, there is still a gap between CGs and the myriad of rule technologies (based on different logic formalisms) that are available to implement CDSSs in real clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: To helpCDSS designers to determine the most suitable rule-based technology (medical-oriented rules, production rules and semantic web rules) with which to model knowledge from CGs for the prescription of antibiotics. We propose a framework of criteria for this purpose that is extensible to more generic CGs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our proposal is based on the identification of core technical requirements extracted from both literature and the analysis of CGs for antibiotics, establishing three dimensions for analysis: language expressivity, interoperability and industrial aspects. We present a case study regarding the John Hopkins Hospital (JHH) Antibiotic Guidelines for Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), a highly recurring hospital acquired infection. We have adopted our framework of criteria in order to analyse and implement these CGs using various rule technologies: HL7 Arden Syntax, general-purpose Production Rules System (Drools), HL7 standard Rule Interchange Format (RIF), Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and SParql Inference Notation (SPIN) rule extensions (implementing our own ontology for UTI). RESULTS: We have identified the main criteria required to attain a maintainable and cost-affordable computable knowledge representation for CGs. We have represented the JHH UTI CGs knowledge in a total of 12 Arden Syntax MLMs, 81 Drools rules and 154 ontology classes, properties and individuals. Our experiments confirm the relevance of the proposed set of criteria and show the level of compliance of the different rule technologies with the JHH UTI CGs knowledge representation. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework of criteria may help clinical institutions to select the most suitable rule technology for the representation of CGs in general, and for the antibiotic prescription domain in particular, depicting the main aspects that lead to Computer Interpretable Guidelines (CIGs), such as Logic expressivity (Open/Closed World Assumption, Negation-As-Failure), Temporal Reasoning and Interoperability with existing HIS and clinical workflow. Future work will focus on providing clinicians with suggestions regarding new potential steps for CGs, considering process mining approaches and CGs Process Workflows, the use of HL7 FHIR for HIS interoperability and the representation of Knowledge-as- a-Service (KaaS).', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This requires a high level of consistency to reduce the effort of data collection and ensure comparisons are valid. Yet, there is considerable variability in local data capture, in the use of data standards and in implemented documentation processes, so organizations struggle to implement quality measures and extract data reliably for comparison across patients, providers, and systems. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we discuss opportunities for harmonization within and across eCQMs; specifically, at the level of the measure concept, the logical clauses or phrases, the data elements, and the codes and value sets. METHODS: The authors, experts in measure development, quality assurance, standards and implementation, reviewed measure structure and content to describe the state of the art for measure analysis and harmonization. Our review resulted in the identification of four measure component levels for harmonization. We provide examples for harmonization of each of the four measure components based on experience with current quality measurement programs including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services eCQM programs. RESULTS: In general, there are significant issues with lack of harmonization across measure concepts, logical phrases, and data elements. This magnifies implementation problems, confuses users, and requires more elaborate data mapping and maintenance. CONCLUSION: Comparisons using semantically equivalent data are needed to accurately measure performance and reduce workflow interruptions with the aim of reducing evidence-based care gaps. It comes as no surprise that electronic health record designed for purposes other than quality improvement and used within a fragmented care delivery system would benefit greatly from common data representation, measure harmony, and consistency.

To provide an efficient decision support, it is necessary to integrate clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) in information systems routinely operated by healthcare professionals, such as hospital information systems (HISs), or by patients deploying their personal health records (PHR). CDSSs should be able to use the semantics and the clinical context of the data imported from other systems and data repositories. A CDSS platform was developed as a set of separate microservices. In this context, we implemented the core components of a CDSS platform, namely its communication services and logical inference components. A fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR)-based CDSS platform addresses the ease of access to clinical decision support services by providing standard-based interfaces and workflows. This type of CDSS may be able to improve the quality of care for doctors who are using HIS without CDSS features. The HL7 FHIR interoperability standards provide a platform usable by all HISs that are FHIR enabled.

Currently, the increasing availability of health data is demanding data-driven approaches, bringing the opportunities to automate healthcare related tasks, providing better disease detection, more accurate prognosis, faster clinical research advance and better fit for patient management. In order to share data with as many stakeholders as possible, interoperability is the only sustainable way for letting systems to talk with one another and getting the complete image of a patient. Thus, it becomes clear that an efficient solution in the data exchange incompatibility is of extreme importance. Consequently, interoperability can develop a communication framework between non-communicable systems, which can be achieved through transforming healthcare data into ontologies. However, the multidimensionality of healthcare domain and the way that is conceptualized, results in the creation of different ontologies with contradicting or overlapping parts. Thus, an effective solution to this problem is the development of methods for finding matches among the various components of ontologies in healthcare, in order to facilitate semantic interoperability. METHODS: The proposed mechanism promises healthcare interoperability through the transformation of healthcare data into the corresponding HL7 FHIR structure. In more detail, it aims at building ontologies of healthcare data, which are later stored into a triplestore. Afterwards, for each constructed ontology the syntactic and semantic similarities with the various HL7 FHIR Resources ontologies are calculated, based on their Levenshtein distance and their semantic fingerprints accordingly. Henceforth, after the aggregation of these results, the matching to the HL7 FHIR Resources takes place, translating the healthcare data into a widely adopted medical standard. RESULTS: Through the derived results it can be seen that there exist cases that an ontology has been matched to a specific HL7 FHIR Resource due to its syntactic similarity, whereas the same ontology has been matched to a different HL7 FHIR Resource due to its semantic similarity. Nevertheless, the developed mechanism performed well since its matching results had exact match with the manual ontology matching results, which are considered as a reference value of high quality and accuracy. Moreover, in order to furtherly investigate the quality of the developed mechanism, it was also evaluated through its comparison with the Alignment API, as well as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) which provide ontology alignment. In both cases, the results of all the different implementations were almost identical, proving the developed mechanism's high efficiency, whereas through the comparison with the NSGA-III algorithm, it was observed that the developed mechanism needs additional improvements, through a potential adoption of the NSGA-III technique. CONCLUSIONS: The developed mechanism creates new opportunities in conquering the field of healthcare interoperability. However, according to the mechanism's evaluation results, it is almost impossible to create syntactic or semantic patterns for understanding the nature of a healthcare dataset. Hence, additional work should be performed in evaluating the developed mechanism, and updating it with respect to the results that will derive from its comparison with similar ontology matching mechanisms and data of multiple nature.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The technological development of communication networks, including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs).', 'FAU': ['S Rubi, Jesus N', 'L Gondim, Paulo R'], 'AU': ['S Rubi JN', 'L Gondim PR'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-7079-6978', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7007-1969'], 'AD': ['Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil. nsuarezrubi@aluno.unb.br.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Brasilia, Brasilia 70910-900, Brazil. pgondim@unb.br.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'GR': ['1646487/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior/'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20191003', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Sensors (Basel)', 'JT': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)', 'JID': '101204366', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Data Aggregation', 'Delivery of Health Care/*trends', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Internet', 'Semantics', 'Software', '*Systems Integration'], 'PMC': 'PMC6806104', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['FHIR', 'IoMT', 'M2M', 'OpenEHR', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'e-Health', 'pervasive healthcare', 'semantic interoperability'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2019/10/19 06:00', 'MHDA': '2020/02/26 06:00', 'PMCR': ['2019/10/01'], 'CRDT': ['2019/10/19 06:00'], 'PHST': ['2019/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/10/01 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['s19194283 [pii]', 'sensors-19-04283 [pii]', '10.3390/s19194283 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Sensors (Basel). 2019 Oct 3;19(19):4283. doi: 10.3390/s19194283.'}

Patients with chronic diseases or comorbidities could benefit the most from chatbots which can keep track of their condition, provide specific information, encourage adherence to medication, etc. To perform these functions, chatbots need a suitable underlying software architecture. In this paper, we introduce a chatbot architecture for chronic patient support grounded on three pillars: scalability by means of microservices, standard data sharing models through HL7 FHIR and standard conversation modeling using AIML. We also propose an innovative automation mechanism to convert FHIR resources into AIML files, thus facilitating the interaction and data gathering of medical and personal information that ends up in patient health records. To align the way people interact with each other using messaging platforms with the chatbot architecture, we propose these very same channels for the chatbot-patient interaction, paying special attention to security and privacy issues. Finally, we present a monitored-data study performed in different chronic diseases, and we present a prototype implementation tailored for one specific chronic disease, psoriasis, showing how this new architecture allows the change, the addition or the improvement of different parts of the chatbot in a dynamic and flexible way, providing a substantial improvement in the development of chatbots used as virtual assistants for chronic patients.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an emerging clinical data standard for exchanging electronic healthcare data and has been used in modeling and integrating both structured and unstructured EHR data for a variety of clinical research applications. The overall objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework for identification of patients with obesity and its multiple comorbidities from semi-structured discharge summaries leveraging a FHIR-based clinical data normalization pipeline (known as NLP2FHIR). METHODS: We implemented a multi-class and multi-label classification system based on the i2b2 Obesity Challenge task to evaluate the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework. Two core parts of the framework are: (a) the conversion of discharge summaries into corresponding FHIR resources - Composition, Condition, MedicationStatement, Procedure and FamilyMemberHistory using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, and (b) the implementation of four machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest) to train classifiers to predict disease state of obesity and 15 comorbidities using features extracted from standard FHIR resources and terminology expansions. We used the macro- and micro-averaged precision (P), recall (R), and F1 score (F1) measures to evaluate the classifier performance. We validated the framework using a second obesity dataset extracted from the MIMIC-III database. RESULTS: Using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, 1237 clinical discharge summaries from the 2008 i2b2 obesity challenge dataset were represented as the instances of the FHIR Composition resource consisting of 5677 records with 16 unique section types. After the NLP processing and FHIR modeling, a set of 244,438 FHIR clinical resource instances were generated. As the results of the four machine learning classifiers, the random forest algorithm performed the best with F1-micro(0.9466)/F1-macro(0.7887) and F1-micro(0.9536)/F1-macro(0.6524) for intuitive classification (reflecting medical professionals' judgments) and textual classification (reflecting the judgments based on explicitly reported information of diseases), respectively. The MIMIC-III obesity dataset was successfully integrated for prediction with minimal configuration of the NLP2FHIR pipeline and machine learning models. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping approach could effectively identify the state of obesity and multiple comorbidities using semi-structured discharge summaries. Our FHIR-based phenotyping approach is a first concrete step towards improving the data aspect of phenotyping portability across EHR systems and enhancing interpretability of the machine learning-based phenotyping algorithms.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To overcome this challenge, we proposed to use Health Level 7's Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) as a meta-CDM-a single standard to represent clinical data. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to create an open-source application termed the Clinical Asset Mapping Program for FHIR (CAMP FHIR) to efficiently transform clinical data to FHIR for supporting source-agnostic CDM-to-FHIR mapping. METHODS: Mapping with CAMP FHIR involves (1) mapping each source variable to its corresponding FHIR element and (2) mapping each item in the source data's value sets to the corresponding FHIR value set item for variables with strict value sets. To date, CAMP FHIR has been used to transform 108 variables from the Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network data models to fields across 7 FHIR resources. It is designed to allow input from any source data model and will support additional FHIR resources in the future. RESULTS: We have used CAMP FHIR to transform data on approximately 23,000 patients with asthma from our institution's i2b2 database. Data quality and integrity were validated against the origin point of the data, our enterprise clinical data warehouse. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that CAMP FHIR can serve as an alternative to implementing new CDMs on a project-by-project basis.

The KETOS platform demonstrated in this work implements a tool for researchers allowing them to perform statistical analyses and deploy resulting models in a secure environment. METHODS: The proposed system uses Docker virtualization to provide researchers with reproducible data analysis and development environments, accessible via Jupyter Notebook, to perform statistical analysis and develop, train and deploy models based on standardized input data. The platform is built in a modular fashion and interfaces with web services using the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to access patient data. In our prototypical implementation we use an OMOP common data model (OMOP-CDM) database. The architecture supports the entire research lifecycle from creating a data analysis environment, retrieving data, and training to final deployment in a hospital setting. RESULTS: We evaluated the platform by establishing and deploying an analysis and end user application for hemoglobin reference intervals within the University Hospital Erlangen. To demonstrate the potential of the system to deploy arbitrary models, we loaded a colorectal cancer dataset into an OMOP database and built machine learning models to predict patient outcomes and made them available via a web service. We demonstrated both the integration with FHIR as well as an example end user application. Finally, we integrated the platform with the open source DataSHIELD architecture to allow for distributed privacy preserving data analysis and training across networks of hospitals. CONCLUSION: The KETOS platform takes a novel approach to data analysis, training and deploying decision support models in a hospital or healthcare setting. It does so in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, combining the flexibility of Docker virtualization with the advantages of standardized vocabularies, a widely applied database schema (OMOP-CDM), and a standardized way to exchange medical data (FHIR).', 'FAU': ['Gruendner, Julian', 'Schwachhofer, Thorsten', 'Sippl, Phillip', 'Wolf, Nicolas', 'Erpenbeck, Marcel', 'Gulden, Christian', 'Kapsner, Lorenz A', 'Zierk, Jakob', 'Mate, Sebastian', 'Sturzl, Michael', 'Croner, Roland', 'Prokosch, Hans-Ulrich', 'Toddenroth, Dennis'], 'AU': ['Gruendner J', 'Schwachhofer T', 'Sippl P', 'Wolf N', 'Erpenbeck M', 'Gulden C', 'Kapsner LA', 'Zierk J', 'Mate S', 'Sturzl M', 'Croner R', 'Prokosch HU', 'Toddenroth D'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0001-7204-5329', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1866-860X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1389-3384'], 'AD': ['Chair of Medical Informatics, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Chair of Medical Informatics, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Chair of Medical Informatics, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Chair of Medical Informatics, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Chair of Medical Informatics, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Chair of Medical Informatics, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Medical Centre for Information and Communication Technology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Medical Centre for Information and Communication Technology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, UniversitatsklinikumErlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Medical Centre for Information and Communication Technology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Surgery, Division of Molecular and Experimental Surgery, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral, Vascular and Graft Surgery, University Hospital, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Chair of Medical Informatics, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Medical Centre for Information and Communication Technology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Chair of Medical Informatics, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], 'DEP': '20191003', 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'PLoS One', 'JT': 'PloS one', 'JID': '101285081', 'RN': ['0 (Hemoglobins)'], 'SB': 'IM', 'EIN': ['PLoS One. 2019 Nov 13;14(11):e0225442. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0225442.

Using interoperability standards, smart contracts, and cryptographic identities, patients can securely exchange data with providers and regulate access. The resulting comprehensive, longitudinal medical records can significantly improve the cost and quality of patient care for individuals and populations alike. OBJECTIVE: This work presents HealthChain, a novel patient-centered blockchain framework. The intent is to bolster patient engagement, data curation, and regulated dissemination of accumulated information in a secure, interoperable environment. A mixed-block blockchain is proposed to support immutable logging and redactable patient blocks. Patient data are generated and exchanged through Health Level-7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, allowing seamless transfer with compliant systems. In addition, patients receive cryptographic identities in the form of public and private key pairs. Public keys are stored in the blockchain and are suitable for securing and verifying transactions. Furthermore, the envisaged system uses proxy re-encryption (PRE) to share information through revocable, smart contracts, ensuring the preservation of privacy and confidentiality. Finally, several PRE improvements are offered to enhance performance and security. METHODS: The framework was formulated to address key barriers to blockchain adoption in health care, namely, information security, interoperability, data integrity, identity validation, and scalability. It supports 16 configurations through the manipulation of 4 modes. An open-source, proof-of-concept tool was developed to evaluate the performance of the novel patient block components and system configurations. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework and evaluate resource consumption, extensive testing was performed on each of the 16 configurations over a variety of scenarios involving a variable number of existing and imported records. RESULTS: The results indicate several clear high-performing, low-bandwidth configurations, although they are not the strongest cryptographically. Of the strongest models, one's anticipated cumulative record size is shown to influence the selection. Although the most efficient algorithm is ultimately user specific, Advanced Encryption Standard-encrypted data with static keys, incremental server storage, and no additional server-side encryption are the fastest and least bandwidth intensive, whereas proxy re-encrypted data with dynamic keys, incremental server storage, and additional server-side encryption are the best performing of the strongest configurations. CONCLUSIONS: Blockchain is a potent and viable technology for patient-centered access to and exchange of health information.

Such an initiative can allow patients to be more proactive in their disease management and clinicians to provide more tailored medical services. Optimally, electronic health record systems (EHRs) should be able to receive self-collected health data in a standard representation of medical data such as Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), from patients systems like mobile health apps and display the data directly to their users-the clinicians. However, although Norwegian EHRs are working on implementing FHIR, no solution or graphical interface is available today to display self-collected health data. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to design and assess a dashboard for displaying relevant self-collected health data from patients with diabetes to clinicians. METHODS: The design relied on an iterative participatory process involving workshops with patients, clinicians, and researchers to define which information should be available and how it should be displayed. The assessment is based on a case study, presenting an instance of the dashboard populated with data collected from one patient with diabetes type 1 (in-house researcher) face-to-face by 14 clinicians. We performed a qualitative analysis based on usability, functionality, and expectation by using responses to questionnaires that were distributed to the 14 clinicians at the end of the workshops and collected before the participants left. The qualitative assessment was guided by the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research. RESULTS: We created a dashboard permitting clinicians to assess the reliability of self-collected health data, list all collected data including medical calculations, and highlight medical situations that need to be investigated to improve the situation of the patients. The dashboard uses a combination of tables, graphs, and other visual representations to display the relevant information. Clinicians think that this type of solution will be useful during consultations every day, especially for patients living in remote areas or those who are technologically interested. CONCLUSIONS: Displaying self-collected health data during consultations is not enough for clinicians; the data reliability has to be assured and the relevant information needs to be extracted and displayed along with the data to ease the introduction during a medical encounter. The prestudy assessment showed that the system provides relevant information to meet clinicians' need and that clinicians were eager to start using it during consultations.

Pilot projects and now actual investigational trials used for regulatory submissions have shown that these benefits support the transformation of clinical research by leveraging EHRs for research. Panelists at a recent collaborative focused on bridging clinical research and clinical care offered varying perspectives on how the latest standards and technologies could be leveraged to facilitate data transfer from EHR systems into clinical research databases, as well as the associated improvements in data quality. Panelists also discussed other avenues to leverage EHR in clinical research. Improvements and exciting possibilities notwithstanding, much work remains. Data ownership and access, attention to metadata and structured data for data sharing, and broader adoption of global standards are key areas for collaboration. With the steady increase in adoption of EHRs around the world, this is an excellent time for all stakeholders to work together and create an environment such that EHRs can be used more readily for research.

However, the immutable and transparent character of this technology may conflict with data privacy regulations and data processing best practices. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to develop a proof-of-concept system for immutable, interoperable, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-compliant exchange of blood glucose data. METHODS: Given that there is no ideal design for a DLT-based patient-provider data exchange solution, we proposed two different variations for our proof-of-concept system. One design was based purely on the public IOTA distributed ledger (a directed acyclic graph-based DLT) and the second used the same public IOTA ledger in combination with a private InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) cluster. Both designs were assessed according to (1) data reversal risk, (2) data linkability risks, (3) processing time, (4) file size compatibility, and (5) overall system complexity. RESULTS: The public IOTA design slightly increased the risk of personal data linkability, had an overall low processing time (requiring mean 6.1, SD 1.9 seconds to upload one blood glucose data sample into the DLT), and was relatively simple to implement. The combination of the public IOTA with a private IPFS cluster minimized both reversal and linkability risks, allowed for the exchange of large files (3 months of blood glucose data were uploaded into the DLT in mean 38.1, SD 13.4 seconds), but involved a relatively higher setup complexity. CONCLUSIONS: For the specific use case of blood glucose explored in this study, both designs presented a suitable performance in enabling the interoperable exchange of data between patients and providers. Additionally, both systems were designed considering the latest guidelines on personal data processing, thereby maximizing the alignment with recent GDPR requirements. For future works, these results suggest that the conflict between DLT and data privacy regulations can be addressed if careful considerations are made regarding the use case and the design of the data exchange system.', 'CI': ['(c)David Hawig, Chao Zhou, Sebastian Fuhrhop, Andre S Fialho, Navin Ramachandran.', 'Originally published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research', '(http://www.jmir.org), 14.06.2019.'], 'FAU': ['Hawig, David', 'Zhou, Chao', 'Fuhrhop, Sebastian', 'Fialho, Andre S', 'Ramachandran, Navin'], 'AU': ['Hawig D', 'Zhou C', 'Fuhrhop S', 'Fialho AS', 'Ramachandran N'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-9762-0163', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2496-6892', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0968-5846', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0586-8680', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7063-7064'], 'AD': ['Pact Care BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Pact Care BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Pact Care BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Pact Care BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Centre for Health Informatics & Multiprofessional Education, University College London, London, United Kingdom.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20190614', 'PL': 'Canada', 'TA': 'J Med Internet Res', 'JT': 'Journal of medical Internet research', 'JID': '100959882', 'RN': ['0 (Blood Glucose)'], 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Blood Glucose/*analysis/*metabolism', 'Computer Communication Networks/*standards', 'Data Analysis', 'Health Information Exchange/*standards', 'Humans', '*Proof of Concept Study'], 'PMC': 'PMC6595943', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['FHIR', 'IOTA', 'IPFS', 'Masked Authenticated Messaging, MAM', 'blockchain', 'blood glucose', 'diabetes', 'directed acyclic graph', 'distributed ledger technology', 'mobile health'], 'COIS': ['Conflicts of Interest: ASF, CZ, DH, and SF received support from the IOTA', 'Foundation, a German nonprofit organization, which aims to support initiatives', 'that explore the use of the IOTA DLT into solving real-world problems.

There is also little information available on how current technical advancements affect German patients' and physicians' trust in PHR systems. METHODS: Supporting scenarios obtained from clinicians, this study proposes a concept for a German PHR system using a public cloud infrastructure, smartphone access and focusing on trust, privacy, and interoperability. In advance to an eventual implementation, a multi-center questionnaire study has been conducted to predict patients' and physicians' intention to use that system and evaluate their trust in different providers of such a system. RESULTS: Our results show that both patients and physicians are highly likely to use the PHR based on the present concept. Trust in healthcare providers exceeds trust in other institutions like private companies, health insurance companies, or even governmental institutions when offering such a PHR system. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the implementation of this PHR system. To maximize patients' and physicians' trust in the system, it should be offered to patients by their healthcare provider.

Imaging-related CELS were represented in standardized formats in the Harvard Medical School Library of Evidence (HLE). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to (1) describe the representation of CELS using established Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), Clinical Quality Language (CQL), and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards and (2) assess the limitations of using these standards to represent imaging-related CELS. METHODS: This study was exempt from review by the Institutional Review Board as it involved no human subjects. Imaging-related clinical recommendations were extracted from evidence sources and translated into CELS. The clinical terminologies of CELS were represented using SNOMED CT and the condition-action logic was represented in CQL and FHIR. Numbers of fully and partially represented CELS were tallied. RESULTS: A total of 765 CELS were represented in the HLE as of December 2018. We were able to fully represent 137 of 765 (17.9%) CELS using SNOMED CT, CQL, and FHIR. We were able to represent terms using SNOMED CT in the temporal component for action ("Then") statements in CQL and FHIR in 755 of 765 (98.7%) CELS. CONCLUSIONS: CELS were represented as shareable clinical decision support (CDS) knowledge artifacts using existing standards-SNOMED CT, FHIR, and CQL-to promote and accelerate adoption of evidence-based practice. Limitations to standardization persist, which could be minimized with an add-on set of standard terms and value sets and by adding time frames to the CQL framework.', 'CI': ['(c)Eseosa Odigie, Ronilda Lacson, Ali Raja, David Osterbur, Ivan Ip, Louise', 'Schneider, Ramin Khorasani.

A mobile CDSS is based on real-time sensor data and historical electronic health record (EHR) data. Raw sensor data have no semantics of their own; therefore, a computer system cannot interpret these data automatically. In addition, the interoperability of sensor data and EHR medical data is a challenge. EHR data collected from distributed systems have different structures, semantics, and coding mechanisms. As a result, building a transparent CDSS that can work as a portable plug-and-play component in any existing EHR ecosystem requires a careful design process. Ontology and medical standards support the construction of semantically intelligent CDSSs. METHODS: This paper proposes a comprehensive MH framework with an integrated CDSS capability. This cloud-based system monitors and manages type 1 diabetes mellitus. The efficiency of any CDSS depends mainly on the quality of its knowledge and its semantic interoperability with different data sources. To this end, this paper concentrates on constructing a semantic CDSS based on proposed FASTO ontology. RESULTS: This realistic ontology is able to collect, formalize, integrate, analyze, and manipulate all types of patient data. It provides patients with complete, personalized, and medically intuitive care plans, including insulin regimens, diets, exercises, and education sub-plans. These plans are based on the complete patient profile. In addition, the proposed CDSS provides real-time patient monitoring based on vital signs collected from patients' wireless body area networks. These monitoring include real-time insulin adjustments, mealtime carbohydrate calculations, and exercise recommendations. FASTO integrates the well-known standards of HL7 fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR), semantic sensor network (SSN) ontology, basic formal ontology (BFO) 2.0, and clinical practice guidelines. The current version of FASTO includes 9577 classes, 658 object properties, 164 data properties, 460 individuals, and 140 SWRL rules. FASTO is publicly available through the National Center for Biomedical Ontology BioPortal at https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/FASTO . CONCLUSIONS: The resulting CDSS system can help physicians to monitor more patients efficiently and accurately. In addition, patients in rural areas can depend on the system to manage their diabetes and emergencies.", 'FAU': ['El-Sappagh, Shaker', 'Ali, Farman', 'Hendawi, Abdeltawab', 'Jang, Jun-Hyeog', 'Kwak, Kyung-Sup'], 'AU': ['El-Sappagh S', 'Ali F', 'Hendawi A', 'Jang JH', 'Kwak KS'], 'AD': ['Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea.', 'Information Systems Department, Faculty of Computer and Informatics, Benha University, Banha, Egypt.', 'Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea.', 'Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, USA.', 'Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Inha University, Incheon, 400-712, South Korea.', 'Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea. kskwak@inha.ac.kr.'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-9559-4352'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], 'DEP': '20190510', 'PL': 'England', 'TA': 'BMC Med Inform Decis Mak', 'JT': 'BMC medical informatics and decision making', 'JID': '101088682', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['*Biological Ontologies', 'Computer Communication Networks', '*Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Semantics', '*Telemedicine'], 'PMC': 'PMC6511155', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['Clinical decision support system', 'Diabetes treatment', 'Mobile health', 'Ontology', 'Semantic interoperability'], 'COIS': ['ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Not applicable.

It also makes health self-management much more feasible, which can partially mitigate one of the challenges that the current healthcare system is facing. Effective and convenient self-management of health requires the collaborative use of health data and home environment data from different services, devices, and even open data on the Web. Although health data interoperability standards including HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and IoT ontology including Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) have been developed and promoted, it is impossible for all the different categories of services to adopt the same standard in the near future. This study presents a method that applies Semantic Web technologies to integrate the health data and home environment data from heterogeneously built services and devices. We propose a Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based integration ontology that models health data from HL7 FHIR standard implemented services, normal Web services and Web of Things (WoT) services and Linked Data together with home environment data from formal ontology-described WoT services. It works on the resource integration layer of the layered integration architecture. An example use case with a prototype implementation shows that the proposed method successfully integrates the health data and home environment data into a resource graph. The integrated data are annotated with semantics and ontological links, which make them machine-understandable and cross-system reusable.', 'FAU': ['Peng, Cong', 'Goswami, Prashant'], 'AU': ['Peng C', 'Goswami P'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-3127-7024', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0891-2859'], 'AD': ['Department of Computer Science, Blekinge Institute of Technology, 371 79 Karlskrona, Sweden. cong.peng@bth.se.', 'Department of Computer Science, Blekinge Institute of Technology, 371 79 Karlskrona, Sweden. prashant.goswami@bth.se.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20190412', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'TA': 'Sensors (Basel)', 'JT': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)', 'JID': '101204366', 'MH': ['Delivery of Health Care/*trends', '*Electronic Health Records', '*Environment', 'Humans', '*Internet', 'Public Health/trends', 'Semantics', 'Systems Integration'], 'PMC': 'PMC6515291', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['FHIR', 'REST', 'Semantic Web', 'Web service', 'WoT', 'eHealth', 'health data integration', 'ontology', 'smart homes'], 'COIS': ['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'], 'EDAT': '2019/04/25 06:00', 'MHDA': '2019/08/14 06:00', 'PMCR': ['2019/04/01'], 'CRDT': ['2019/04/25 06:00'], 'PHST': ['2019/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]'], 'AID': ['s19081747 [pii]', 'sensors-19-01747 [pii]', '10.3390/s19081747 [doi]'], 'PST': 'epublish', 'SO': 'Sensors (Basel). 2019 Apr 12;19(8):1747. doi: 10.3390/s19081747.'}

Yet, only very few applications have been reported because of the limited accessibility of device data due to the lack of adoption of open standards, and the complexity of regulatory/approval requirements for AI-based systems. The fragmentation of data, still being stored in isolated silos, results in limited accessibility for AI in healthcare and machine learning is complicated by the loss of semantics in data conversions. We outline a reference model that addresses the requirements of innovative AI-based research systems as well as the clinical reality. The integration of networked medical devices and Clinical Repositories based on open standards, such as IEEE 11073 SDC and HL7 FHIR, will foster novel assistance and decision support. The reference model will make point-of-care device data available for AI-based approaches. Semantic interoperability between Clinical and Research Repositories will allow correlating patient data, device data, and the patient outcome.

Many medical research projects and organizations use metadata repositories to edit, store and reuse data elements. However, existing metadata repositories differ regarding software implementation and have shortcomings when it comes to exchanging metadata. This work aims to define a uniform interface with a technical interlingua between the different MDR implementations in order to enable and facilitate the exchange of metadata, to query over distributed systems and to promote cooperation. To design a unified interface for multiple existing MDRs, a standardized data model must be agreed on. The ISO 11179 is an international standard for the representation of metadata, and since most MDR systems claim to be at least partially compliant, it is suitable for defining an interface thereupon. Therefore, each repository must be able to define which parts can be served and the interface must be able to handle highly linked data. GraphQL is a data access layer and defines query techniques designed to navigate easily through complex data structures. RESULTS: We propose QL(4)MDR, an ISO 11179-3 compatible GraphQL query language. The GraphQL schema for QL(4)MDR is derived from the ISO 11179 standard and defines objects, fields, queries and mutation types. Entry points within the schema define the path through the graph to enable search functionalities, but also the exchange is promoted by mutation types, which allow creating, updating and deleting of metadata. QL(4)MDR is the foundation for the uniform interface, which is implemented in a modern web-based interface prototype. CONCLUSIONS: We have introduced a uniform query interface for metadata repositories combining the ISO 11179 standard for metadata repositories and the GraphQL query language. A reference implementation based on the existing Samply.MDR was implemented. The interface facilitates access to metadata, enables better interaction with metadata as well as a basis for connecting existing repositories. We invite other ISO 11179-based metadata repositories to take this approach into account.', 'FAU': ['Ulrich, H', 'Kern, J', 'Tas, D', 'Kock-Schoppenhauer, A K', 'Uckert, F', 'Ingenerf, J', 'Lablans, M'], 'AU': ['Ulrich H', 'Kern J', 'Tas D', 'Kock-Schoppenhauer AK', 'Uckert F', 'Ingenerf J', 'Lablans M'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-8349-6798'], 'AD': ['IT Center for Clinical Research, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany. hannes.ulrich@itcr.uni-luebeck.de.', 'Federated Information Systems, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Federated Information Systems, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'IT Center for Clinical Research, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Medical Informatics in Translational Oncology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'IT Center for Clinical Research, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Lubeck, Lubeck, Germany.', 'Federated Information Systems, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], 'DEP': '20190318', 'PL': 'England', 'TA': 'BMC Med Inform Decis Mak', 'JT': 'BMC medical informatics and decision making', 'JID': '101088682', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['*Health Information Interoperability', 'Humans', '*Medical Informatics Applications', '*Metadata'], 'PMC': 'PMC6421684', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['GraphQL', 'HL7 FHIR', 'Interoperability', 'Metadata repository'], 'COIS': ['ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Not applicable.

This manuscript focuses on a data transformation mechanism that can take full advantage of a data intensive environment without losing the realistic complexity of health, confronting the challenges of heterogeneous data. The developed mechanism involves running ontology alignment and transformation operations in healthcare datasets, stored into a triple-based data store, and restructuring it according to specified criteria, discovering the correspondence and possible transformations between the ingested data and specific Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) through semantic and ontology alignment techniques.

In addition, the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator has recognized the trend toward storing complete sequencing data outside the EHR in a Genomic Archiving and Communication System (GACS) and has emphasized the need for "pilots that test Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Genomics for GACS integration with EHRs." We sought to develop a PGx clinical decision support (CDS) service, leveraging the emerging FHIR and CDS Hooks standards, and based on an assumption that pharmacogene sequencing data would be stored alongside the EHR in a GACS. METHODS: We developed a PGx CDS service as a functional prototype. The service is triggered by a medication order in the EHR. When evoked, the service looks for relevant genetic data in a GACS and returns corresponding recommendations back to the ordering clinician. Where the patient has no genetic data on file, the service can recommend pretreatment genetic testing where applicable. RESULTS: Overall, we were able to meet our objectives and deploy a functional prototype, interfaced with a commercial EHR. We identified several areas where FHIR or CDS Hooks lacked necessary semantics or have implementation ambiguity. Primary FHIR challenges included multiple ways to say the same thing, which exacerbated the complexity of variant to allele conversion and lack of representation of deoxyribonucleic acid region(s) studied. Primary CDS Hooks challenges included the complexity of executing an authenticated query against one system (GACS) upon being triggered by a different system (the EHR), and limitations in the types of actionable recommendations that can be returned to the EHR. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have found that PGx CDS based on FHIR and CDS Hooks appears to represent a promising means of genomics-EHR integration.

Traditionally, health data standards are complex and test-driven methods played important roles in achieving interoperability. The Health Level Seven International (HL7) standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) may be a technical solution that aligns with policy, but systems need to be validated and tested. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to explore the question of whether or not the regular use of validation and testing tools improves server compliance with the HL7 FHIR specification. METHODS: We used two independent validation and testing tools, Crucible and Touchstone, and analyzed the usage and result data to determine their impact on server compliance with the HL7 FHIR specification. RESULTS: The use of validation and testing tools such as Crucible and Touchstone are strongly correlated with increased compliance and "practice makes perfect." Frequent and thorough testing has clear implications for health data interoperability. Additional data analysis reveals trends over time with respect to vendors, use cases, and FHIR versions. CONCLUSIONS: Validation and testing tools can aid in the transition to an interoperable health care infrastructure.

CDS Hooks is a specification for an interface to call CDS services from an electronic health record. Implementing the CDS Hooks interface into ArdenSuite, an Arden-Syntax-based CDS platform, will further enhance its interoperability with external systems. METHODS: The development of this interface consisted of three parts: (1) The RESTful interface defined by CDS Hooks had to be implemented; this included the support of specifically formatted data for the input and output of the CDS functions. (2) The existing FHIR connector had to be adjusted. In CDS Hooks, a FHIR server can be defined for each CDS service call individually. In the current version of the connector, a FHIR server has to be configured in advance to call the CDS service. (3) Additional data points that did not exist previously, such as a description or hook for each CDS service, had to be collected and saved. RESULTS: Basic support of the CDS Hooks API was established in the ArdenSuite and tested. The FHIR connector was adapted. DISCUSSION: The missing parts for full CDS Hooks support were implemented. As a use case, we employed Hepaxpert, an interpretive system for hepatitis serology tests. CDS Hooks defines FHIR as the only data source.

This paper discusses some of the challenges behind this slow uptake and describes a clinical terminology server implementation that aims to overcome these obstacles and contribute to the widespread adoption of standardised clinical terminologies. RESULTS: Ontoserver is a clinical terminology server based on the Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Some of its key features include: out-of-the-box support for SNOMED CT, LOINC and OWL ontologies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO); a fast, prefix-based search algorithm to ensure users can easily find content and are not discouraged from entering coded data; a syndication mechanism to facilitate keeping terminologies up to date; and a full implementation of SNOMED CT's Expression Constraint Language (ECL), which enables sophisticated data analytics. CONCLUSIONS: Ontoserver has been designed to overcome some of the challenges that have hindered adoption of standardised clinical terminologies and is used in several organisations throughout Australia.

RESULTS: Within the DFG-funded project "MAGIC" (Grant Number HO 1937/5-1) the digital consent management service tool gICS was enhanced to comply with the recommendations published in the TMF data protection guideline for medical research. In addition, a structured exchange format for modular consent templates considering established standards and formats in the area of digital informed consent management was designed. Using the new FHIR standard and the HAPI FHIR library, the first version for an exchange format and necessary import-/export-functionalities were successfully implemented. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed exchange format is a "work in progress". It represents a starting point for current discussions concerning digital consent management. It also attempts to improve interoperability between different approaches within the wider IHE-/HL7-/FHIR community.

Several factors support this process. Advances in omics allows individualization of diagnosis and treatment. Patient awareness and easy availability of data on the Internet allows patients to become informed decision makers when it comes even to disease management. Mass media emphasize the issue of medical errors, making patients demanding for quality in medical care. In some healthcare settings, patents face a problem of interpreting medical data and making decisions on treatment tactics without having a doctor, who could potentially support them. Delegating this task to a Patient Decision Aide system can add automatically generated recommendations to result reports without adding significant workload on the doctors, increase patients' motivation and support their decisions. We have implemented a patient decision aid system based on the productions rules, which: Collects data from available sources; Automatically analyses and interprets laboratory test results; Recommends running additional tests for a more precise diagnostic; Delivers automatically generated reports to doctors and patients in a natural language. To achieve semantic interoperability with other systems we have implemented a FHIR engine. The knowledge base has been organized as a graph structure.

This is especially true for vulnerable and complex patient populations such as pediatric patients with special needs. Despite wide adoption of electronic health records (EHR), current EHR systems do not adequately support the visualization and management of care teams within and across health care organizations. Electronic health information exchange has the potential to address this issue. In the present study, we assessed the adequacy of available health information exchange data standards to support the information needs related to care coordination of complex pediatric patients. METHODS: We derived data elements from the information needs of clinicians and parents to support patient care teams; and mapped them to data elements in the Health Level Seven (HL7) Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) standard and in the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. We also identified additional C-CDA data elements and FHIR resources that include patients\' care team members. RESULTS: Information about care team members involved in patient care is generally well-represented in the C-CDA and FHIR specifications. However, there are gaps related to patients\' non-clinical events and care team actions. In addition, there is no single place to find information about care team members; rather, information about practitioners and organizations may be available in several different types of C-CDA data elements and FHIR resources. CONCLUSION: Through standards-based electronic health information exchange, it appears to be feasible to build patient care team representations irrespective of the location of patient care. In order to gather care team information across disparate systems, exchange of multiple C-CDA documents and/or execution of multiple FHIR queries will be necessary. This approach has the potential to enable comprehensive patient care team views that may help improve care coordination.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

HiGHmed brings together 24 partners from academia and industry, aiming at improvements in care provision, biomedical research and epidemiology. By establishing a shared information governance framework, data integration centers and an open platform architecture in cooperation with independent healthcare providers, the meaningful reuse of data will be facilitated. Complementary, HiGHmed integrates a total of seven Medical Informatics curricula to develop collaborative structures and processes to train medical informatics professionals, physicians and researchers in new forms of data analytics. GOVERNANCE AND POLICIES: We describe governance structures and policies that have proven effective during the conceptual phase. These were further adapted to take into account the specific needs of the development and networking phase, such as roll-out, carerelated aspects and our focus on curricula development in Medical Inform atics. ARCHITECTURAL FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY: To address the challenges of organizational, technical and semantic interoperability, a concept for a scalable platform architecture, the HiGHmed Platform, was developed. We outline the basic principles and design goals of the open platform approach as well as the roles of standards and specifications such as IHE XDS, openEHR, SNOMED CT and HL7 FHIR. A shared governance framework provides the semantic artifacts which are needed to establish semantic interoperability. USE CASES: Three use cases in the fields of oncology, cardiology and infection control will demonstrate the capabilities of the HiGHmed approach. Each of the use cases entails diverse challenges in terms of data protection, privacy and security, including clinical use of genome sequencing data (oncology), continuous longitudinal monitoring of physical activity (cardiology) and cross-site analysis of patient movement data (infection control). DISCUSSION: Besides the need for a shared governance framework and a technical infrastructure, backing from clinical leaders is a crucial factor.

Future medicine will be predictive, preventive, personalized, participatory and digital. Data and knowledge at comprehensive depth and breadth need to be available for research and at the point of care as a basis for targeted diagnosis and therapy. Data integration and data sharing will be essential to achieve these goals. For this purpose, the consortium Data Integration for Future Medicine (DIFUTURE) will establish Data Integration Centers (DICs) at university medical centers. OBJECTIVES: The infrastructure envisioned by DIFUTURE will provide researchers with cross-site access to data and support physicians by innovative views on integrated data as well as by decision support components for personalized treatments. The aim of our use cases is to show that this accelerates innovation, improves health care processes and results in tangible benefits for our patients. To realize our vision, numerous challenges have to be addressed. The objective of this article is to describe our concepts and solutions on the technical and the organizational level with a specific focus on data integration and sharing. GOVERNANCE AND POLICIES: Data sharing implies significant security and privacy challenges. Therefore, state-of-the-art data protection, modern IT security concepts and patient trust play a central role in our approach. We have established governance structures and policies safeguarding data use and sharing by technical and organizational measures providing highest levels of data protection. One of our central policies is that adequate methods of data sharing for each use case and project will be selected based on rigorous risk and threat analyses. Interdisciplinary groups have been installed in order to manage change. ARCHITECTURAL FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY: The DIFUTURE Data Integration Centers will implement a three-step approach to integrating, harmonizing and sharing structured, unstructured and omics data as well as images from clinical and research environments. First, data is imported and technically harmonized using common data and interface standards (including various IHE profiles, DICOM and HL7 FHIR). Second, data is preprocessed, transformed, harmonized and enriched within a staging and working environment. Third, data is imported into common analytics platforms and data models (including i2b2 and tranSMART) and made accessible in a form compliant with the interoperability requirements defined on the national level. Secure data access and sharing will be implemented with innovative combinations of privacy-enhancing technologies (safe data, safe settings, safe outputs) and methods of distributed computing. USE CASES: From the perspective of health care and medical research, our approach is disease-oriented and use-case driven, i.e. following the needs of physicians and researchers and aiming at measurable benefits for our patients. We will work on early diagnosis, tailored therapies and therapy decision tools with focuses on neurology, oncology and further disease entities. Our early uses cases will serve as blueprints for the following ones, verifying that the infrastructure developed by DIFUTURE is able to support a variety of application scenarios.

However, there are many standards for defining such data, hindering communication between different healthcare providers. Even with adopted standards, patients often need to repeatedly provide their health information when they are taken care of at different locations. This problem hinders the adoption of personal health record (PHR), with the patients' health records under their own control. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an interoperability model for PHR use. The methodology consisted prototyping an application model named OmniPHR, to evaluate the structuring of semantic interoperability and integration of different health standards, using a real database from anonymized patients. We evaluated health data from a hospital database with 38 645 adult patients' medical records processed using different standards, represented by openEHR, HL7 FHIR, and MIMIC-III reference models. OmniPHR demonstrated the feasibility to provide interoperability through a standard ontology and artificial intelligence with natural language processing (NLP). Although the first executions reached a 76.39% F1-score and required retraining of the machine-learning process, the final score was 87.9%, presenting a way to obtain the original data from different standards on a single format.

Integration of unstructured data into a standard data model, however, poses unique challenges partially due to heterogeneous type systems used in existing clinical NLP systems. We introduce a scalable and standards-based framework for integrating structured and unstructured EHR data leveraging the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) specification. We implemented a clinical NLP pipeline enhanced with an FHIR-based type system and performed a case study using medication data from Mayo Clinic\'s EHR. Two UIMA-based NLP tools known as MedXN and MedTime were integrated in the pipeline to extract FHIR MedicationStatement resources and related attributes from unstructured medication lists. We developed a rule-based approach for assigning the NLP output types to the FHIR elements represented in the type system, whereas we investigated the FHIR elements belonging to the source of the structured EMR data. We used the FHIR resource "MedicationStatement" as an example to illustrate our integration framework and methods. For evaluation, we manually annotated FHIR elements in 166 medication statements from 14 clinical notes generated by Mayo Clinic in the course of patient care, and used standard performance measures (precision, recall and f-measure). The F-scores achieved ranged from 0.73 to 0.99 for the various FHIR element representations.

Constructing predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient's record. We propose a representation of patients' entire raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization. We validated our approach using de-identified EHR data from two US academic medical centers with 216,221 adult patients hospitalized for at least 24 h. In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting: in-hospital mortality (area under the receiver operator curve [AUROC] across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed traditional, clinically-used predictive models in all cases.

Solving the interoperability problem would require a strong focus on data integration and standardization in telemedicine infrastructures. Our objective was to suggest a future-proof architecture, that consisted of small loose-coupled modules to allow flexible integration with new and existing services, and the use of international standards to allow high re-usability of modules, and interoperability in the health IT landscape. METHODS: We identified core features of our future-proof architecture as the following (1) To provide extended functionality the system should be designed as a core with modules. Database handling and implementation of security protocols are modules, to improve flexibility compared to other frameworks. (2) To ensure loosely coupled modules the system should implement an inversion of control mechanism. (3) A focus on ease of implementation requires the system should use HL7 FHIR (Fast Interoperable Health Resources) as the primary standard because it is based on web-technologies. RESULTS: We evaluated the feasibility of our architecture by developing an open source implementation of the system called ORDS. ORDS is written in TypeScript, and makes use of the Express Framework and HL7 FHIR DSTU2. The code is distributed on GitHub. All modules have been tested unit wise, but end-to-end testing awaits our first clinical example implementations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that highly adaptable and yet interoperable core frameworks for telemedicine can be designed and implemented. Future work includes implementation of a clinical use case and evaluation.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, standards have been developed and used to provide interoperability between personal health devices (PHDs) and external systems. ISO/IEEE 11073 standards and IHE PCD-01 standard messages have been used the most in the exchange of observation data of health devices. Recently, transmitting observation data using the HL7 FHIR standard has been devised in the name of DoF (Devices on FHIR) and adopted very fast. We compare and analyze these standards and suggest that which standard will work best at the different environments of device usage. METHODS: We generated each message/resource of the three standards for observed vital signs from blood pressure monitor and thermometer. Then, the size, the contents, and the exchange processes of these messages are compared and analyzed. RESULTS: ISO/IEEE 11073 standard message has the smallest data size, but it has no ability to contain the key information, patient information. On the other hand, PCD-01 messages and FHIR standards have the fields for patient information. HL7 DoF standards provide reusing of information unit known as resource, and it is relatively easy to parse DoF messages since it uses widely known XML and JSON. CONCLUSIONS: ISO/IEEE 11073 standards are suitable for devices having very small computing power. IHE PCD-01 and HL7 DoF messages can be used for the devices that need to be connected to hospital information systems that require patient information.

The rising death rates from opioid overdose have caused healthcare practitioners and researchers to work on optimizing pain therapy and limiting the prescriptions for pain medications. The state of New York has implemented a prescription drug monitoring program(PDMP), amended public health law to limit the prescription of opioids for acute pain and utilized the resources of the state and county health departments to help in curbing this epidemic. The recent publication of guidelines for prescription opioids from CDC [1] and ASIPP (American Society of Interventional pain practitioners) have independently reviewed literature and found good evidence of limiting opioid prescription for acute and chronic non cancer pain. [2] Method Over the last decade, advanced technology has increased the complexity of electronic health records systems leading to the development of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) to aid the work flow of healthcare providers. There are several systematic reviews on the effectiveness and utility of CDSSs. A common consensus is that commercially and locally developed CDSS are effective in improving patient measures while actual workload improvement and efficient cost-cutting measure are not significantly improved by CDSS. Patient provider involvement in developing CDSS is a determinant of its success and utilization rates. [7] Therefore, a plug and play form of CDSS which can be implemented from an external platform through secure channels would be more effective. Design The Health Level Seven's (HL7) open licensed interoperability standard Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) has a platform, Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART) for CDSS app development by a third party.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed Synthea, an open-source software package that simulates the lifespans of synthetic patients, modeling the 10 most frequent reasons for primary care encounters and the 10 chronic conditions with the highest morbidity in the United States. RESULTS: Synthea adheres to a previously developed conceptual framework, scales via open-source deployment on the Internet, and may be extended with additional disease and treatment modules developed by its user community. One million synthetic patient records are now freely available online, encoded in standard formats (eg, Health Level-7 [HL7] Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources [FHIR] and Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture), and accessible through an HL7 FHIR application program interface. DISCUSSION: Health care lags other industries in information technology, data exchange, and interoperability. The lack of freely distributable health records has long hindered innovation in health care. Approaches and tools are available to inexpensively generate synthetic health records at scale without accidental disclosure risk, lowering current barriers to entry for promising early-stage developments. By engaging a growing community of users, the synthetic data generated will become increasingly comprehensive, detailed, and realistic over time.

To lessen the prohibitive costs of conducting these studies and support evidence-based medicine, results emanating from these studies need to be shared and compared to one another. Current approaches for clinical study management have limitations that prohibit the effective sharing of clinical research data. METHODS: The objective of this paper is to present a proposal for a clinical study architecture to not only facilitate the communication of clinical study data but also its context so that the data that is being communicated can be unambiguously understood at the receiving end. Our approach is two-fold. First we outline our methodology to map clinical data from Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium Operational Data Model (ODM) to the Fast Healthcare Interoperable Resource (FHIR) and outline the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Next, we propose two FHIR-based models, to capture the metadata and data from the clinical study, that not only facilitate the syntactic but also semantic interoperability of clinical study data. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows that our proposed FHIR resources provide a good fit to semantically enrich the ODM data. By exploiting the rich information model in FHIR, we can organise clinical data in a manner that preserves its organisation but captures its context. Our implementations demonstrate that FHIR can natively manage clinical data. Furthermore, by providing links at several levels, it improves the traversal and querying of the data. The intended benefits of this approach is more efficient and effective data exchange that ultimately will allow clinicians to switch their focus back to decision-making and evidence-based medicines.', 'FAU': ['Leroux, Hugo', 'Metke-Jimenez, Alejandro', 'Lawley, Michael J'], 'AU': ['Leroux H', 'Metke-Jimenez A', 'Lawley MJ'], 'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-2033-8178'], 'AD': ["The Australian E-Health Research Centre, CSIRO Health and Biosecurity, Level 5, Health Sciences Building 901/16, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, 4029, Queensland, Australia. hugo.leroux@csiro.au.", "The Australian E-Health Research Centre, CSIRO Health and Biosecurity, Level 5, Health Sciences Building 901/16, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, 4029, Queensland, Australia.", "The Australian E-Health Research Centre, CSIRO Health and Biosecurity, Level 5, Health Sciences Building 901/16, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, 4029, Queensland, Australia."], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20170919', 'PL': 'England', 'TA': 'J Biomed Semantics', 'JT': 'Journal of biomedical semantics', 'JID': '101531992', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['*Delivery of Health Care', 'Humans', 'Medical Informatics/*methods', '*Semantics', 'Systems Integration'], 'PMC': 'PMC5606031', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'OT': ['CDISC ODM', 'Clinical research data', 'FHIR', 'Interoperability', 'Longitudinal clinical study'], 'COIS': ['ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Not applicable.

Current trends rely on differentiating the representation of data instances from the definition of clinical information models. The dual model approach, which combines a reference model (RM) and a clinical information model (CIM), sets in practice this software design pattern. The most recent initiative, proposed by HL7, is called Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR). The aim of our study was to investigate the feasibility of applying the FHIR standard to modeling and exposing EHR data of the Georges Pompidou European Hospital (HEGP) integrating biology and the bedside (i2b2) clinical data warehouse (CDW). RESULTS: We implemented a FHIR server over i2b2 to expose EHR data in relation with five FHIR resources: DiagnosisReport, MedicationOrder, Patient, Encounter, and Medication. The architecture of the server combines a Data Access Object design pattern and FHIR resource providers, implemented using the Java HAPI FHIR API. Two types of queries were tested: query type #1 requests the server to display DiagnosticReport resources, for which the diagnosis code is equal to a given ICD-10 code. A total of 80 DiagnosticReport resources, corresponding to 36 patients, were displayed. Query type #2, requests the server to display MedicationOrder, for which the FHIR Medication identification code is equal to a given code expressed in a French coding system. A total of 503 MedicationOrder resources, corresponding to 290 patients, were displayed. Results were validated by manually comparing the results of each request to the results displayed by an ad-hoc SQL query. CONCLUSION: We showed the feasibility of implementing a Java layer over the i2b2 database model to expose data of the CDW as a set of FHIR resources. An important part of this work was the structural and semantic mapping between the i2b2 model and the FHIR RM. To accomplish this, developers must manually browse the specifications of the FHIR standard.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this work is to explore available biosignal file format and data exchange standards and profiles, and to conceptualise end-to-end solutions. METHODS: The authors reviewed and discussed available biosignal file format standards with other members of international standards development organisations (SDOs). RESULTS: A raw concept for standards based acquisition, storage, archiving and sharing of biosignals was developed. The GDF format may serve for storing biosignals. Signals can then be shared using FHIR resources and may be stored on FHIR servers or in DICOM archives, with DICOM waveforms as one possible format. CONCLUSION: Currently a group of international SDOs (e.g. HL7, IHE, DICOM, IEEE) is engaged in intensive discussions.

FHIR resources are defined in a specialized modeling language. FHIR instances can currently be represented in either XML or JSON. The FHIR and Semantic Web communities are developing a third FHIR instance representation format in Resource Description Framework (RDF). Shape Expressions (ShEx), a formal RDF data constraint language, is a candidate for describing and validating the FHIR RDF representation. OBJECTIVE: Create a FHIR to ShEx model transformation and assess its ability to describe and validate FHIR RDF data. METHODS: We created the methods and tools that generate the ShEx schemas modeling the FHIR to RDF specification being developed by HL7 ITS/W3C RDF Task Force, and evaluated the applicability of ShEx in the description and validation of FHIR to RDF transformations. RESULTS: The ShEx models contributed significantly to workgroup consensus. Algorithmic transformations from the FHIR model to ShEx schemas and FHIR example data to RDF transformations were incorporated into the FHIR build process. ShEx schemas representing 109 FHIR resources were used to validate 511 FHIR RDF data examples from the Standards for Trial Use (STU 3) Ballot version. We were able to uncover unresolved issues in the FHIR to RDF specification and detect 10 types of errors and root causes in the actual implementation. The FHIR ShEx representations have been included in the official FHIR web pages for the STU 3 Ballot version since September 2016. DISCUSSION: ShEx can be used to define and validate the syntax of a FHIR resource, which is complementary to the use of RDF Schema (RDFS) and Web Ontology Language (OWL) for semantic validation. CONCLUSION: ShEx proved useful for describing a standard model of FHIR RDF data. The combination of a formal model and a succinct format enabled comprehensive review and automated validation.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: We created a custom SMART on FHIR-compatible server infrastructure written in Node.js that served two primary functions. First, it handled API management activities such rate-limiting, authorization, auditing, logging, and analytics. Second, it retrieved the EHR data and made it available in a FHIR-compatible format. Finally, we made required changes to the EHR user interface to allow us to integrate several compatible apps into the provider- and patient-facing EHR workflows. RESULTS: After integrating SMART on FHIR into our Epic-based EHR, we demonstrated several types of apps running on the infrastructure. This included both provider- and patient-facing apps as well as apps that are closed source, open source and internally-developed. We integrated the apps into the testing environment of our desktop EHR as well as our patient portal.

RAPID3 is correlated significantly with DAS28 (Disease Activity Score) and CDAI (Clinical Disease Activity Index), and distinguishes active from control treatments as efficiently as these indices in clinical trials involving adalimumab, abatacept, certolizumab, infliximab, and rituximab. Many versions of an electronic RAPID3 (eRAPID3) have been developed, which are incompatible with one another, as seen for electronic medical records (EMR). Therefore, opportunities are lost to pool data from many sites for advancement of patient care and outcomes. Interfaces for linkage to EMRs and pooling of data are available as Health Level Seven (HL7) standards, FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources), and innovative open platforms like SMART (Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technology), but many eRAPID3 versions do not have this capacity. RAPID3 scores may be elevated in many patients due to damage or distress, rather than, or in addition to, inflammation, a problem that also affects DAS28, CDAI, and all RA indices which include a patient global estimate, even if they include a formal joint count. A full MDHAQ, of which RAPID3 is a component, provides clues to the presence of damage, and/or distress and adds much further information, with no more work for the health professional and little more time for the patient. A RheuMetric physician checklist of global scores for inflammation, damage, and distress is also useful to recognise damage and/or distress, but not available with most available eRAPID3 versions. Many eRAPID3 versions also are limited by the absence of flowsheets to monitor scores over time, the absence of strategies to convey data to health professionals to improve care, and the absence of advanced features for patients and doctors which are available in some versions of an eRAPID3. It is recommended that eRAPID3 should include a full MDHAQ, RheuMetric checklist, a longitudinal flowsheet of scores, and a defined strategy for management of the data to be available to the physician for improved patient care, to enhance value and quantitative interpretation of RAPID3 scores.', 'FAU': ['Pincus, Theodore'], 'AU': ['Pincus T'], 'AD': ['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA. tedpincus@gmail.com.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article', 'Review'], 'DEP': '20161018', 'PL': 'Italy', 'TA': 'Clin Exp Rheumatol', 'JT': 'Clinical and experimental rheumatology', 'JID': '8308521', 'SB': 'IM', 'MH': ['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*diagnosis/physiopathology/psychology/therapy', 'Cell Phone', 'Checklist', 'Disability Evaluation', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Health Status', '*Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', '*Medical Informatics', 'Mobile Applications', 'Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Rheumatology/*methods', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Telemedicine'], 'EDAT': '2016/10/21 06:00', 'MHDA': '2017/02/07 06:00', 'CRDT': ['2016/10/21 06:00'], 'PHST': ['2016/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [entrez]'], 'AID': ['11197 [pii]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Clin Exp Rheumatol. 2016 Sep-Oct;34(5 Suppl 101):S49-S53.

Modification of the HAQ was viewed as similar to improving a laboratory test, with a primary focus on clinical value for diagnosis, prognosis, and/or management, as well as feasibility for minimal effect on clinical workflow. Rigorous attention, was also directed to validity, reliability, other methodologic and technological considerations, but after clinical value and feasibility were established. A longer "intake" MDHAQ was introduced for new patients to record a complete past medical history - illnesses, hospitalisations, surgeries, allergies, family history, social history and medications. MDHAQ scales not found on the HAQ record complex activities, sleep quality, anxiety, depression, self-report joint count, fatigue, symptom checklist, morning stiffness, exercise status, recent medical history, social history and demographic data within 2 pages on one sheet of paper. An electronic eMDHAQ/RAPID3 provides a similar platform to pool data from multiple sites. A patient may be offered a patient-administered, password-protected, secure, web site, to store the medical history completed on the eMDHAQ. This eMDHAQ would allow a patient to complete a single general medical history questionnaire rather than different intake questionnaires in different medical settings. The eMDHAQ would be available for updates and correction by the patient for future visits, regardless of electronic medical record (EMR). The eMDHAQ is designed to interface with an EMR using HL7 (health level seven) and SMART (Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technology) on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), although implementation requires collaboration with the EMR vendor.

Integration of cancer clinical data and cancer genomic information poses unique challenges, because of the high volume and complexity of clinical data, as well as the heterogeneity and instability of cancer genome data when compared with germline data. Current information models of clinical and genomic data are not sufficiently expressive to represent individual observations and to aggregate those observations into longitudinal summaries over the course of cancer care. These models are acutely needed to support the development of systems and tools for generating the so called clinical "deep phenotype" of individual cancer patients, a process which remains almost entirely manual in cancer research and precision medicine. METHODS: Reviews of existing ontologies and interviews with cancer researchers were used to inform iterative development of a cancer phenotype information model. We translated a subset of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) models into the OWL 2 Description Logic (DL) representation, and added extensions as needed for modeling cancer phenotypes with terms derived from the NCI Thesaurus. Models were validated with domain experts and evaluated against competency questions. RESULTS: The DeepPhe Information model represents cancer phenotype data at increasing levels of abstraction from mention level in clinical documents to summaries of key events and findings. We describe the model using breast cancer as an example, depicting methods to represent phenotypic features of cancers, tumors, treatment regimens, and specific biologic behaviors that span the entire course of a patient\'s disease.

Since most electronic health record (EHR) systems do not yet provide such functionality, we developed an EHR-agnostic, clinico-genomic mobile app to demonstrate several features that will be needed for point-of-care conversations. METHODS: Our prototype, called Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technology (SMART)(R) PCM, visualizes genomic information in real time, comparing a patient's diagnosis-specific somatic gene mutations detected by PCR-based hotspot testing to a population-level set of comparable data. The initial prototype works for patient specimens with 0 or 1 detected mutation. Genomics extensions were created for the Health Level Seven(R) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)(R) standard; otherwise, the prototype is a normal SMART on FHIR app. RESULTS: The PCM prototype can rapidly present a visualization that compares a patient's somatic genomic alterations against a distribution built from more than 3000 patients, along with context-specific links to external knowledge bases. Initial evaluation by oncologists provided important feedback about the prototype's strengths and weaknesses. We added several requested enhancements and successfully demonstrated the app at the inaugural American Society of Clinical Oncology Interoperability Demonstration; we have also begun to expand visualization capabilities to include cancer specimens with multiple mutations. DISCUSSION: PCM is open-source software for clinicians to present the individual patient within the population-level spectrum of cancer somatic mutations.

The project was called Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART). METHODS: We adopted contemporary web standards for application programming interface transport, authorization, and user interface, and standard medical terminologies for coded data. In our initial design, we created our own openly licensed clinical data models to enforce consistency and simplicity. During the second half of 2013, we updated SMART to take advantage of the clinical data models and the application-programming interface described in a new, openly licensed Health Level Seven draft standard called Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR). Signaling our adoption of the emerging FHIR standard, we called the new platform SMART on FHIR. RESULTS: We introduced the SMART on FHIR platform with a demonstration that included several commercial healthcare IT vendors and app developers showcasing prototypes at the Health Information Management Systems Society conference in February 2014. This established the feasibility of SMART on FHIR, while highlighting the need for commonly accepted pragmatic constraints on the base FHIR specification. CONCLUSION: In this paper, we describe the creation of SMART on FHIR, relate the experience of the vendors and developers who built SMART on FHIR prototypes, and discuss some challenges in going from early industry prototyping to industry-wide production use.", 'CI': ['(c) The Author 2016.

While several standards exist for structured entry of adverse sensitivity information, many clinicians record this data as free text. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to 1) identify and compare the existing common adverse sensitivity information models, and 2) to evaluate the coverage of the adverse sensitivity information models for representing allergy information on a subset of inpatient and outpatient adverse sensitivity clinical notes. METHODS: We compared four common adverse sensitivity information models: Health Level 7 Allergy and Intolerance Domain Analysis Model, HL7-DAM; the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, FHIR; the Consolidated Continuity of Care Document, C-CDA; and OpenEHR, and evaluated their coverage on a corpus of inpatient and outpatient notes (n = 120). RESULTS: We found that allergy specialists' notes had the highest frequency of adverse sensitivity attributes per note, whereas emergency department notes had the fewest attributes. Overall, the models had many similarities in the central attributes which covered between 75% and 95% of adverse sensitivity information contained within the notes. However, representations of some attributes (especially the value-sets) were not well aligned between the models, which is likely to present an obstacle for achieving data interoperability. Also, adverse sensitivity exceptions were not well represented among the information models.

An FHIR application protocol interface (API) layer was attached to proprietary sequencing platforms and EHRs in order to expose gene variant data for presentation to the end-user. Three representative apps based on the SMART platform were built to test end-to-end feasibility, including integration of genomic and clinical data. RESULTS: Successful design, deployment, and use of the API was demonstrated and adopted by HL7 Clinical Genomics Workgroup.

HL7 FHIR was created as an evolution of the messaging standards to achieve semantic interoperability. FHIR is somehow similar to other approaches like the dual model methodology as both are based on the precise modeling of clinical information. In this paper, we demonstrate how we can apply the dual model methodology to standards like FHIR. We show the usefulness of this approach for data transformation between FHIR and other specifications such as HL7 CDA, EN ISO 13606, and openEHR. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of defining archetypes over FHIR, and the consequences and outcomes of this approach. Finally, we exemplify this approach by creating a testing data server that supports both FHIR resources and archetypes.', 'FAU': ['Bosca, Diego', 'Moner, David', 'Maldonado, Jose Alberto', 'Robles, Montserrat'], 'AU': ['Bosca D', 'Moner D', 'Maldonado JA', 'Robles M'], 'AD': ['Instituto Universitario de Aplicaciones de las Tecnologias de la Informacion y Comunicaciones Avanzadas.', 'Instituto Universitario de Aplicaciones de las Tecnologias de la Informacion y Comunicaciones Avanzadas.', 'Instituto Universitario de Aplicaciones de las Tecnologias de la Informacion y Comunicaciones Avanzadas.', 'Instituto Universitario de Aplicaciones de las Tecnologias de la Informacion y Comunicaciones Avanzadas.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'PL': 'Netherlands', 'TA': 'Stud Health Technol Inform', 'JT': 'Studies in health technology and informatics', 'JID': '9214582', 'MH': ['Electronic Health Records/*standards', 'Health Information Systems/*standards', 'Health Level Seven/*standards', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/*standards', 'Medical Record Linkage/*standards', 'Semantics', 'Spain', 'Terminology as Topic', '*Vocabulary, Controlled'], 'EDAT': '2015/05/21 06:00', 'MHDA': '2016/11/01 06:00', 'CRDT': ['2015/05/21 06:00'], 'PHST': ['2015/05/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [medline]'], 'PST': 'ppublish', 'SO': 'Stud Health Technol Inform. 2015;210:180-4.'}

In this paper we demonstrate a software architecture for developing and deploying clinical predictive models using web services via the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. The services enable model development using electronic health records (EHRs) stored in OMOP CDM databases and model deployment for scoring individual patients through FHIR resources. The MIMIC2 ICU dataset and a synthetic outpatient dataset were transformed into OMOP CDM databases for predictive model development. The resulting predictive models are deployed as FHIR resources, which receive requests of patient information, perform prediction against the deployed predictive model and respond with prediction scores. To assess the practicality of this approach we evaluated the response and prediction time of the FHIR modeling web services. We found the system to be reasonably fast with one second total response time per patient prediction.', 'FAU': ['Khalilia, Mohammed', 'Choi, Myung', 'Henderson, Amelia', 'Iyengar, Sneha', 'Braunstein, Mark', 'Sun, Jimeng'], 'AU': ['Khalilia M', 'Choi M', 'Henderson A', 'Iyengar S', 'Braunstein M', 'Sun J'], 'AD': ['Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.'], 'LA': ['eng'], 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'DEP': '20151105', 'PL': 'United States', 'TA': 'AMIA Annu Symp Proc', 'JT': 'AMIA ...
